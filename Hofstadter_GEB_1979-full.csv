"61","Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering. The book opens with the story of Bach's Musical"
"62","   Offering. Bach made an impromptu visit to King Frederick the Great of Prussia, and was"
"63","   requested to improvise upon a theme presented by the King. His improvisations formed the basis"
"64","   of that great work. The Musical Offering and its story form a theme upon which I ""improvise"""
"65","   throughout the book, thus making a sort of ""Metamusical Offering"". Self-reference and the"
"66","   interplay between different levels in Bach are discussed: this leads to a discussion of parallel"
"67","   ideas in Escher's drawings and then Gödel’s Theorem. A brief presentation of the history of logic"
"68","   and paradoxes is given as background for Gödel’s Theorem. This leads to mechanical reasoning"
"69","   and computers, and the debate about whether Artificial Intelligence is possible. I close with an"
"70","   explanation of the origins of the book-particularly the why and wherefore of the Dialogues."
"71","Three-Part Invention. Bach wrote fifteen three-part inventions. In this three-part Dialogue, the"
"72","   Tortoise and Achilles-the main fictional protagonists in the Dialogues-are ""invented"" by Zeno (as"
"73","   in fact they were, to illustrate Zeno's paradoxes of motion). Very short, it simply gives the flavor"
"74","   of the Dialogues to come."
"75","Chapter I: The MU-puzzle. A simple formal system (the MIL'-system) is presented, and the reader"
"76","   is urged to work out a puzzle to gain familiarity with formal systems in general. A number of"
"77","   fundamental notions are introduced: string, theorem, axiom, rule of inference, derivation, formal"
"78","   system, decision procedure, working inside/outside the system."
"79","Two-Part Invention. Bach also wrote fifteen two-part inventions. This two-part Dialogue was written"
"80","   not by me, but by Lewis Carroll in 1895. Carroll borrowed Achilles and the Tortoise from Zeno,"
"81","   and I in turn borrowed them from Carroll. The topic is the relation between reasoning, reasoning"
"82","   about reasoning, reasoning about reasoning about reasoning, and so on. It parallels, in a way,"
"83","   Zeno's paradoxes about the impossibility of motion, seeming to show, by using infinite regress,"
"84","   that reasoning is impossible. It is a beautiful paradox, and is referred to several times later in the"
"85","   book."
"86","Chapter II: Meaning and Form in Mathematics. A new formal system (the pq-system) is"
"87","   presented, even simpler than the MIU-system of Chapter I. Apparently meaningless at first, its"
"88","   symbols are suddenly revealed to possess meaning by virtue of the form of the theorems they"
"89","   appear in. This revelation is the first important insight into meaning: its deep connection to"
"90","   isomorphism. Various issues related to meaning are then discussed, such as truth, proof, symbol"
"91","   manipulation, and the elusive concept, ""form""."
"92","Sonata for Unaccompanied Achilles. A Dialogue which imitates the Bach Sonatas for"
"93","   unaccompanied violin. In particular, Achilles is the only speaker, since it is a transcript of one"
"94","   end of a telephone call, at the far end of which is the Tortoise. Their conversation concerns the"
"95","   concepts of ""figure"" and ""ground"" in various"
"96","   Overview                                                                                           IV"
"97",""
"98","    contexts- e.g., Escher's art. The Dialogue itself forms an example of the distinction, since"
"99","    Achilles' lines form a ""figure"", and the Tortoise's lines-implicit in Achilles' lines-form a ""ground""."
"100","Chapter III: Figure and Ground. The distinction between figure and ground in art is compared to"
"101","    the distinction between theorems and nontheorems in formal systems. The question ""Does a"
"102","    figure necessarily contain the same information as its ground%"" leads to the distinction between"
"103","    recursively enumerable sets and recursive sets."
"104","Contracrostipunctus. This Dialogue is central to the book, for it contains a set of paraphrases of"
"105","    Gödel’s self-referential construction and of his Incompleteness Theorem. One of the paraphrases"
"106","    of the Theorem says, ""For each record player there is a record which it cannot play."" The"
"107","    Dialogue's title is a cross between the word ""acrostic"" and the word ""contrapunctus"", a Latin word"
"108","    which Bach used to denote the many fugues and canons making up his Art of the Fugue. Some"
"109","    explicit references to the Art of the Fugue are made. The Dialogue itself conceals some acrostic"
"110","    tricks."
"111","Chapter IV: Consistency, Completeness, and Geometry. The preceding Dialogue is explicated to"
"112","    the extent it is possible at this stage. This leads back to the question of how and when symbols in"
"113","    a formal system acquire meaning. The history of Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry is given,"
"114","    as an illustration of the elusive notion of ""undefined terms"". This leads to ideas about the"
"115","    consistency of different and possibly ""rival"" geometries. Through this discussion the notion of"
"116","    undefined terms is clarified, and the relation of undefined terms to perception and thought"
"117","    processes is considered."
"118","Little Harmonic Labyrinth. This is based on the Bach organ piece by the same name. It is a playful"
"119","    introduction to the notion of recursive-i.e., nested structures. It contains stories within stories. The"
"120","    frame story, instead of finishing as expected, is left open, so the reader is left dangling without"
"121","    resolution. One nested story concerns modulation in music-particularly an organ piece which"
"122","    ends in the wrong key, leaving the listener dangling without resolution."
"123","Chapter V: Recursive Structures and Processes. The idea of recursion is presented in many"
"124","    different contexts: musical patterns, linguistic patterns, geometric structures, mathematical"
"125","    functions, physical theories, computer programs, and others."
"126","Canon by Intervallic Augmentation. Achilles and the Tortoise try to resolve the question, ""Which"
"127","    contains more information-a record, or the phonograph which plays it This odd question arises"
"128","    when the Tortoise describes a single record which, when played on a set of different"
"129","    phonographs, produces two quite different melodies: B-A-C-H and C-A-G-E. It turns out,"
"130","    however, that these melodies are ""the same"", in a peculiar sense."
"131","Chapter VI: The Location of Meaning. A broad discussion of how meaning is split among coded"
"132","    message, decoder, and receiver. Examples presented include strands of DNA, undeciphered"
"133","    inscriptions on ancient tablets, and phonograph records sailing out in space. The relationship of"
"134","    intelligence to ""absolute"" meaning is postulated."
"135","Chromatic Fantasy, And Feud. A short Dialogue bearing hardly any resemblance, except in title, to"
"136","    Bach's Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue. It concerns the proper way to manipulate sentences so as"
"137","    to preserve truth-and in particular the question"
"138","    Overview                                                                                              V"
"139",""
"140","   of whether there exist rules for the usage of the word ""arid"". This Dialogue has much in common"
"141","   with the Dialogue by Lewis Carroll."
"142","Chapter VII: The Propositional Calculus. It is suggested how words such as .,and"" can be"
"143","   governed by formal rules. Once again, the ideas of isomorphism and automatic acquisition of"
"144","   meaning by symbols in such a system are brought up. All the examples in this Chapter,"
"145","   incidentally, are ""Zentences""-sentences taken from Zen koans. This is purposefully done,"
"146","   somewhat tongue-in-cheek, since Zen koans are deliberately illogical stories."
"147","Crab Canon. A Dialogue based on a piece by the same name from the Musical Offering. Both are so"
"148","   named because crabs (supposedly) walk backwards. The Crab makes his first appearance in this"
"149","   Dialogue. It is perhaps the densest Dialogue in the book in terms of formal trickery and level-"
"150","   play. Gödel, Escher, and Bach are deeply intertwined in this very short Dialogue."
"151","Chapter VIII: Typographical Number Theory. An extension of the Propositional Calculus called"
"152","   ""TNT"" is presented. In TNT, number-theoretical reasoning can be done by rigid symbol"
"153","   manipulation. Differences between formal reasoning and human thought are considered."
"154","A Mu Offering. This Dialogue foreshadows several new topics in the book. Ostensibly concerned"
"155","   with Zen Buddhism and koans, it is actually a thinly veiled discussion of theoremhood and"
"156","   nontheoremhood, truth and falsity, of strings in number theory. There are fleeting references to"
"157","   molecular biology-particular) the Genetic Code. There is no close affinity to the Musical"
"158","   Offering, other than in the title and the playing of self-referential games."
"159","Chapter IX: Mumon and Gödel. An attempt is made to talk about the strange ideas of Zen"
"160","   Buddhism. The Zen monk Mumon, who gave well known commentaries on many koans, is a"
"161","   central figure. In a way, Zen ideas bear a metaphorical resemblance to some contemporary ideas"
"162","   in the philosophy of mathematics. After this ""Zennery"", Gödel’s fundamental idea of Gödel-"
"163","   numbering is introduced, and a first pass through Gödel’s Theorem is made."
"164","                                            Part II: EGB"
"165","Prelude ... This Dialogue attaches to the next one. They are based on preludes and fugues from"
"166","   Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier. Achilles and the Tortoise bring a present to the Crab, who has a"
"167","   guest: the Anteater. The present turns out to be a recording of the W.T.C.; it is immediately put"
"168","   on. As they listen to a prelude, they discuss the structure of preludes and fugues, which leads"
"169","   Achilles to ask how to hear a fugue: as a whole, or as a sum of parts? This is the debate between"
"170","   holism and reductionism, which is soon taken up in the Ant Fugue."
"171","Chapter X: Levels of Description, and Computer Systems. Various levels of seeing pictures,"
"172","   chessboards, and computer systems are discussed. The last of these is then examined in detail."
"173","   This involves describing machine languages, assembly languages, compiler languages, operating"
"174","   systems, and so forth. Then the discussion turns to composite systems of other types, such as"
"175","   sports teams, nuclei, atoms, the weather, and so forth. The question arises as to how man"
"176","   intermediate levels exist-or indeed whether any exist."
"177","   Overview                                                                                       VI"

"179","   …Ant Fugue. An imitation of a musical fugue: each voice enters with the same statement. The"

"181","   composed of smaller words. etc. The words which appear on the four levels of this strange picture"
"182","   are ""HOLISM"", ""REDLCTIONIsM"", and ""ML"". The discussion veers off to a friend of the"
"183","   Anteater's Aunt Hillary, a conscious ant colony. The various levels of her thought processes are"
"184","   the topic of discussion. Many fugal tricks are ensconced in the Dialogue. As a hint to the reader,"

"196","   of whether languages, or indeed minds, can be ""mapped"" onto each other. How is communication"
"197","   possible between two separate physical brains: What do all human brains have in common? A"
"198","   geographical analogy is used to suggest an answer. The question arises, ""Can a brain be"

"200","Aria with Diverse Variations. A Dialogue whose form is based on Bach's Goldberg Variations, and"
"201","   whose content is related to number-theoretical problems such as the Goldbach conjecture. This"
"202","   hybrid has as its main purpose to show how number theory's subtlety stems from the fact that"
"203","   there are many diverse variations on the theme of searching through an infinite space. Some of"
"204","   them lead to infinite searches, some of them lead to finite searches, while some others hover in"

"302","Author:"
"303","   FREDERICK THE GREAT, King of Prussia, came to power in 1740. Although he is"
"304","remembered in history books mostly for his military astuteness, he was also devoted to"
"305","the life of the mind and the spirit. His court in Potsdam was one of the great centers of"
"306","intellectual activity in Europe in the eighteenth century. The celebrated mathematician"
"307","Leonhard Euler spent twenty-five years there. Many other mathematicians and scientists"
"308","came, as well as philosophers-including Voltaire and La Mettrie, who wrote some of their"
"309","most influential works while there."
"310","   But music was Frederick's real love. He was an avid flutist and composer. Some of his"
"311","compositions are occasionally performed even to this day. Frederick was one of the first"
"312","patrons of the arts to recognize the virtues of the newly developed ""piano-forte"" (""soft-"
"313","loud""). The piano had been developed in the first half of the eighteenth century as a"
"314","modification of the harpsichord. The problem with the harpsichord was that pieces could"
"315","only be played at a rather uniform loudness-there was no way to strike one note more"
"316","loudly than its neighbors. The ""soft-loud"", as its name implies, provided a remedy to this"
"317","problem. From Italy, where Bartolommeo Cristofori had made the first one, the soft-loud"
"318","idea had spread widely. Gottfried Silbermann, the foremost German organ builder of the"
"319","day, was endeavoring to make a ""perfect"" piano-forte. Undoubtedly King Frederick was"
"320","the greatest supporter of his efforts-it is said that the King owned as many as fifteen"
"321","Silbermann pianos!"
"322","                                           Bach"
"323","Frederick was an admirer not only of pianos, but also of an organist and composer by the"
"324","name of J. S. Bach. This Bach's compositions were somewhat notorious. Some called"
"325","them ""turgid and confused"", while others claimed they were incomparable masterpieces."
"326","But no one disputed Bach's ability to improvise on the organ. In those days, being an"
"327","organist not only meant being able to play, but also to extemporize, and Bach was known"
"328","far and wide for his remarkable extemporizations. (For some delightful anecdotes about"
"329","Bach's extemporization, see The Bach Reader, by H. T. David and A. Mendel.)"
"330","   In 1747, Bach was sixty-two, and his fame, as well as one of his sons, had reached"
"331","Potsdam: in fact, Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach was the Capellmeister (choirmaster) at the"
"332","court of King Frederick. For years the King had let it be known, through gentle hints to"
"333","Philipp Emanuel, how"

"336","pleased he would be to have the elder Bach come and pay him a visit; but this wish had"
"337","never been realized. Frederick was particularly eager for Bach to try out his new"
"338","Silbermann pianos, which lie (Frederick) correctly foresaw as the great new wave in"
"339","music."
"340","   It was Frederick's custom to have evening concerts of chamber music in his court."
"341","Often he himself would be the soloist in a concerto for flute Here we have reproduced a"
"342","painting of such an evening by the German painter Adolph von Menzel, who, in the"
"343","1800's, made a series of paintings illustrating the life of Frederick the Great. At the"
"344","cembalo is C. P. E. Bach, and the figure furthest to the right is Joachim Quantz, the"
"345","King's flute master-and the only person allowed to find fault with the King's flute"
"346","playing. One May evening in 1747, an unexpected guest showed up. Johann Nikolaus"
"347","Forkel, one of Bach's earliest biographers, tells the story"
"348","as follows:"
"349","  One evening, just as lie was getting his flute ready, and his musicians were ssembled,"
"350","  an officer brought him a list of the strangers who had arrived. With his flute in his hand"
"351","  he ran ever the list, but immediately turned to the assembled musicians, and said, with a"
"352","  kind of agitation, ""Gentlemen, old Bach is come."" The Hute was now laid aside, and old"
"353","  Bach, who had alighted at his son's lodgings, was immediately summoned to the Palace."
"354","  Wilhelm Friedemann, who accompanied his father, told me this story, and I must say"
"355","  that 1 still think with pleasure on the manner in which lie related it. At that time it was"
"356","  the fashion to make rather prolix compliments. The first appearance of J. S. Bach before"
"357","  se great a King, who did not even give him time to change his traveling dress for a"
"358","  black chanter's gown, must necessarily be attended with many apologies. I will net here"
"359","  dwell en these apologies, but merely observe, that in Wilhelm Friedemann's mouth they"
"360","  made a formal Dialogue between the King and the Apologist."
"361","  But what is mere important than this is that the King gave up his Concert for this"
"362","  evening, and invited Bach, then already called the Old Bach, to try his fortepianos,"
"363","  made by Silbermann, which steed in several rooms of the palace. [Forkel here inserts"
"364","  this footnote: ""The pianofortes manufactured by Silbermann, of Frevberg, pleased the"
"365","  King se much, that he resolved to buy them all up. He collected fifteen. I hear that they"
"366","  all now stand unfit for use in various corners of the Royal Palace.""] The musicians went"
"367","  with him from room to room, and Bach was invited everywhere to try them and to play"
"368","  unpremeditated compositions. After he had gene en for some time, he asked the King to"
"369","  give him a subject for a Fugue, in order to execute it immediately without any"
"370","  preparation. The King admired the learned manner in which his subject was thus"
"371","  executed extempore: and, probably to see hew far such art t could be carried, expressed"
"372","  a wish to hear a Fugue with six Obligato parts. But as it is not every subject that is fit"
"373","  for such full harmony, Bach chose one himself, and immediately executed it to the"
"374","  astonishment of all present in the same magnificent and learned manner as he had done"
"375","  that of the King. His Majesty desired also to hear his performance en the organ. The"
"376","  next day therefore Bach was taken to all the organs in Potsdam, as lie had before been"
"377","  to Silbermann's fortepianos. After his return to Leipzig, he composed the subject, which"
"378","  he had received from the King, in three and six parts. added several artificial passages"
"379","  in strict canon to it, and had it engraved, under the title of ""Musikalisches Opfer"""

"385","   When Bach sent a copy of his Musical Offering to the King, he included a dedicatory"
"386","letter, which is of interest for its prose style if nothing else rather submissive and"
"387","flattersome. From a modern perspective it seems comical. Also, it probably gives"

"393","    my visit in Potsdam, Your Majesty's Self deigned to play to me a theme for a fugue"

"395","    Your Majesty's most august presence. To obey Your Majesty's command was my most"
"396","    humble dim. I noticed very soon, however, that, for lack of necessary preparation, the"
"397","    execution of the task did not fare as well as such an excellent theme demanded. I"
"398","    resoled therefore and promptly pledged myself to work out this right Royal theme"
"399","    more fully, and then make it known to the world. This resolve has now been carried"
"400","    out as well as possible, and it has none other than this irreproachable intent, to glorify,"
"401","    if only in a small point, the fame of a monarch whose greatness and power, as in all"
"402","    the sciences of war and peace, so especially in music, everyone must admire and"

"409","Leipzig, July 7 1747"
"410","  Some twenty-seven years later, when Bach had been dead for twentyfour years, a Baron"
"411","named Gottfried van Swieten-to whom, incidentally, Forkel dedicated his biography of"
"412","Bach, and Beethoven dedicated his First Symphony-had a conversation with King"
"413","Frederick, which he reported as follows:"
"414","    He [Frederick] spoke to me, among other things, of music, and of a great organist"
"415","    named Bach, who has been for a while in Berlin. This artist [Wilhelm Friedemann"
"416","    Bach] is endowed with a talent superior, in depth of harmonic knowledge and power"
"417","    of execution, to any 1 have heard or can imagine, while those who knew his father"
"418","    claim that he, in turn, was even greater. The King"
"419","Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering                                                     14"
"420",""
"421","    is of this opinion, and to prove it to me he sang aloud a chromatic fugue subject which"
"422","    he had given this old Bach, who on the spot had made of it a fugue in four parts, then"
"423","    in five parts, and finally in eight parts.'"
"424","   Of course there is no way of knowing whether it was King Frederick or Baron van"
"425","Swieten who magnified the story into larger-than-life proportions. But it shows how"
"426","powerful Bach's legend had become by that time. To give an idea of how extraordinary a"
"427","six-part fugue is, in the entire Well-Tempered Clavier by Bach, containing forty-eight"
"428","Preludes and Fugues, only two have as many as five parts, and nowhere is there a six-part"
"429","fugue! One could probably liken the task of improvising a six-part fugue to the playing of"
"430","sixty simultaneous blindfold games of chess, and winning them all. To improvise an"
"431","eight-part fugue is really beyond human capability."
"432","   In the copy which Bach sent to King Frederick, on the page preceding the first sheet of"
"433","music, was the following inscription:"
"434","FIG URE 4."
"435","(""At the King's Command, the Song and the Remainder Resolved with Canonic Art."")"
"436","Here Bach is punning on the word ""canonic"", since it means not only ""with canons"" but"
"437","also ""in the best possible way"". The initials of this inscription are"
"438","                                        RICERCAR"
"439","-an Italian word, meaning ""to seek"". And certainly there is a great deal to seek in the"
"440","Musical Offering. It consists of one three-part fugue, one six-part fugue, ten canons, and a"
"441","trio sonata. Musical scholars have concluded that the three-part fugue must be, in"
"442","essence, identical with the one which Bach improvised for King Frederick. The six-part"
"443","fugue is one of Bach's most complex creations, and its theme is, of course, the Royal"
"444","Theme. That theme, shown in Figure 3, is a very complex one, rhythmically irregular and"
"445","highly chromatic (that is, filled with tones which do not belong to the key it is in). To"
"446","write a decent fugue of even two voices based on it would not be easy for the average"
"447","musician!"
"448","   Both of the fugues are inscribed ""Ricercar"", rather than ""Fuga"". This is another"
"449","meaning of the word; ""ricercar"" was, in fact, the original name for the musical form now"
"450","known as ""fugue"". By Bach's time, the word ""fugue"" (or fuga, in Latin and Italian) had"
"451","become standard, but the term ""ricercar"" had survived, and now designated an erudite"
"452","kind of fugue, perhaps too austerely intellectual for the common ear. A similar usage"
"453","survives in English today: the word ""recherche"" means, literally, ""sought out"", but carries"
"454","the same kind of implication, namely of esoteric or highbrow cleverness."
"455","   The trio sonata forms a delightful relief from the austerity of the fugues and canons,"
"456","because it is very melodious and sweet, almost dance-"
"457","Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering                                                  15"
"458",""
"459","able. Nevertheless, it too is based largely on the King's theme, chromatic and austere as it"
"460","is. It is rather miraculous that Bach could use such a theme to make so pleasing an"
"461","interlude."
"462","  The ten canons in the Musical Offering are among the most sophisticated canons Bach"
"463","ever wrote. However, curiously enough, Bach himself never wrote them out in full. This"
"464","was deliberate. They were posed as puzzles to King Frederick. It was a familiar musical"
"465","game of the day to give a single theme, together with some more or less tricky hints, and"
"466","to let the canon based on that theme be ""discovered"" by someone else. In order to know"
"467","how this is possible, you must understand a few facts about canons."
"468","                                      Canons and Fugues"
"469","The idea of a canon is that one single theme is played against itself. This is done by"
"470","having ""copies"" of the theme played by the various participating voices. But there are"
"471","means' ways to do this. The most straightforward of all canons is the round, such as"
"472","""Three Blind Mice"", ""Row, Row, Row Your Boat"", or "" Frere Jacques"". Here, the theme"
"473","enters in the first voice and, after a fixed time-delay, a ""copy"" of it enters, in precisely the"
"474","same key. After the same fixed time-delay in the second voice, the third voice enters"
"475","carrying the theme, and so on. Most themes will not harmonize with themselves in this"
"476","way. In order for a theme to work as a canon theme, each of its notes must be able to"
"477","serve in a dual (or triple, or quadruple) role: it must firstly be part of a melody, and"
"478","secondly it must be part of a harmonization of the same melody. When there are three"
"479","canonical voices, for instance, each note of the theme must act in two distinct harmonic"
"480","ways, as well as melodically. Thus, each note in a canon has more than one musical"
"481","meaning; the listener's ear and brain automatically figure out the appropriate meaning, by"
"482","referring to context."
"483","  There are more complicated sorts of canons, of course. The first escalation in"
"484","complexity comes when the ""copies"" of the theme are staggered not only in time, but also"
"485","in pitch; thus, the first voice might sing the theme starting on C, and the second voice,"
"486","overlapping with the first voice, might sing the identical theme starting five notes higher,"
"487","on G. A third voice, starting on the D yet five notes higher, might overlap with the first"
"488","two, and so on. The next escalation in complexity comes when the speeds of' the different"
"489","voices are not equal; thus, the second voice might sing twice as quickly, or twice as"
"490","slowly, as the first voice. The former is called diminution, the latter augmentation (since"
"491","the theme seems to shrink or to expand)."
"492","  We are not yet done! The next stage of complexity in canon construction is to invert the"
"493","theme, which means to make a melody which jumps down wherever the original theme"
"494","jumps up, and by exactly the same number of semitones. This is a rather weird melodic"
"495","transformation, but when one has heard many themes inverted, it begins to seem quite"
"496","natural. Bach was especially fond of inversions, and they show up often in his work-and"
"497","the Musical Offering is no exception. (For a simple example of"
"498","Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering                                                       16"
"499",""
"500","inversion, try the tune ""Good King Wenceslas"". When the original and its inversion are"
"501","sung together, starting an octave apart and staggered with a time-delay of two beats, a"
"502","pleasing canon results.) Finally, the most esoteric of ""copies"" is the retrograde copy-"
"503","where the theme is played backwards in time. A canon which uses this trick is"
"504","affectionately known as a crab canon, because of the peculiarities of crab locomotion."
"505","Bach included a crab canon in the Musical Offering, needless to say. Notice that every"
"506","type of ""copy"" preserves all the information in the original theme, in the sense that the"
"507","theme is fully recoverable from any of the copies. Such an information preserving"
"508","transformation is often called an isomorphism, and we will have much traffic with"
"509","isomorphisms in this book."
"510","   Sometimes it is desirable to relax the tightness of the canon form. One way is to allow"
"511","slight departures from perfect copying, for the sake of more fluid harmony. Also, some"
"512","canons have ""free"" voices-voices which do not employ the canon's theme, but which"
"513","simply harmonize agreeably with the voices that are in canon with each other."
"514","   Each of the canons in the Musical Offering has for its theme a different variant of the"
"515","King's Theme, and all the devices described above for making canons intricate are"
"516","exploited to the hilt; in fact, they are occasionally combined. Thus, one three-voice canon"
"517","is labeled ""Canon per Augmentationem, contrario Motu""; its middle voice is free (in fact,"
"518","it sings the Royal Theme), while the other two dance canonically above and below it,"
"519","using the devices of augmentation and inversion. Another bears simply the cryptic label"
"520","""Quaerendo invenietis"" (""By seeking, you will discover""). All of the canon puzzles have"
"521","been solved. The canonical solutions were given by one of Bach's pupils, Johann Philipp"
"522","Kirnberger. But one might still wonder whether there are more solutions to seek!"
"523","   I should also explain briefly what a fugue is. A fugue is like a canon, in that it is"
"524","usually based on one theme which gets played in different voices and different keys, and"
"525","occasionally at different speeds or upside down or backwards. However, the notion of"
"526","fugue is much less rigid than that of canon, and consequently it allows for more"
"527","emotional and artistic expression. The telltale sign of a fugue is the way it begins: with a"
"528","single voice singing its theme. When it is done, then a second voice enters, either five"
"529","scale-notes up, or four down. Meanwhile the first voice goes on, singing the"
"530","""countersubject"": a secondary theme, chosen to provide rhythmic, harmonic, and melodic"
"531","contrasts to the subject. Each of the voices enters in turn, singing the theme, often to the"
"532","accompaniment of the countersubject in some other voice, with the remaining voices"
"533","doing whatever fanciful things entered the composer's mind. When all the voices have"
"534","""arrived"", then there are no rules. There are, to be sure, standard kinds of things to do-but"
"535","not so standard that one can merely compose a fugue by formula. The two fugues in the"
"536","Musical Offering are outstanding examples of fugues that could never have been"
"537","""composed by formula"". There is something much deeper in them than mere fugality."
"538","   All in all, the Musical Offering represents one of Bach's supreme accomplishments in"
"539","counterpoint. It is itself one large intellectual fugue, in"
"540","Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering                                                    17"

"542","which many ideas and forms have been woven together, and in which playful double"
"543","meanings and subtle allusions are commonplace. And it is a very beautiful creation of the"
"544","human intellect which we can appreciate forever. (The entire work is wonderfully"
"545","described in the book f. S. Bach's Musical Offering, by H. T. David.)"
"546","                                 An Endlessly Rising Canon"
"547","There is one canon in the Musical Offering which is particularly unusual. Labeled simply"
"548","""Canon per Tonos"", it has three voices. The uppermost voice sings a variant of the Royal"
"549","Theme, while underneath it, two voices provide a canonic harmonization based on a"
"550","second theme. The lower of this pair sings its theme in C minor (which is the key of the"

"552","pitch by an interval of a fifth. What makes this canon different from any other, however,"
"553","is that when it concludes-or, rather, seems to conclude-it is no longer in the key of C"
"554","minor, but now is in D minor. Somehow Bach has contrived to modulate (change keys)"
"555","right under the listener's nose. And it is so constructed that this ""ending"" ties smoothly"
"556","onto the beginning again; thus one can repeat the process and return in the key of E, only"
"557","to join again to the beginning. These successive modulations lead the ear to increasingly"
"558","remote provinces of tonality, so that after several of them, one would expect to be"
"559","hopelessly far away from the starting key. And yet magically, after exactly six such"
"560","modulations, the original key of C minor has been restored! All the voices are exactly one"
"561","octave higher than they were at the beginning, and here the piece may be broken off in a"
"562","musically agreeable way. Such, one imagines, was Bach's intention; but Bach indubitably"
"563","also relished the implication that this process could go on ad infinitum, which is perhaps"
"564","why he wrote in the margin ""As the modulation rises, so may the King's Glory."" To"
"565","emphasize its potentially infinite aspect, I like to call this the ""Endlessly Rising Canon""."
"566","   In this canon, Bach has given us our first example of the notion of Strange Loops. The"
"567","""Strange Loop"" phenomenon occurs whenever, by moving upwards (or downwards)"
"568","through the levels of some hierarchical system, we unexpectedly find ourselves right"
"569","back where we started. (Here, the system is that of musical keys.) Sometimes I use the"
"570","term Tangled Hierarchy to describe a system in which a Strange Loop occurs. As we go"
"571","on, the theme of Strange Loops will recur again and again. Sometimes it will be hidden,"
"572","other times it will be out in the open; sometimes it will be right side up, other times it will"
"573","be upside down, or backwards. ""Quaerendo invenietis"" is my advice to the reader."

"630","level in a drawing might clearly be recognizable as representing fantasy or imagination;"
"631","another level would be recognizable as reality. These two levels might be the only"
"632","explicitly portrayed levels. But the mere presence of these two levels invites the viewer to"

"635","there is always another level above it of greater ""reality"", and likewise, there is always a"

"637","what happens if the chain of levels is not linear, but forms a loop? What is real, then, and"

"653","mathematical systems has its origins in simple and ancient intuitions. In its absolutely"
"654","barest form, Godel's discovery involves the translation of an ancient paradox in"
"655","philosophy into mathematical terms. That paradox is the so-called Epimenides paradox,"
"656","or liar paradox. Epimenides was a Cretan who made one immortal statement: ""All"
"657","Cretans are liars."" A sharper version of the statement is simply ""I am lying""; or, ""This"
"658","statement is false"". It is that last version which I will usually mean when I speak of the"
"659","Epimenides paradox. It is a statement which rudely violates the usually assumed"
"660","dichotomy of statements into true and false, because if you tentatively think it is true,"
"661","then it immediately backfires on you and makes you think it is false. But once you've"
"662","decided it is false, a similar backfiring returns you to the idea that it must be true. Try it!"
"663","   The Epimenides paradox is a one-step Strange Loop, like Escher's Print Gallery. But"
"664","how does it have to do with mathematics? That is what Godel discovered. His idea was to"
"665","use mathematical reasoning in exploring mathematical reasoning itself. This notion of"
"666","making mathematics ""introspective"" proved to be enormously powerful, and perhaps its"
"667","richest implication was the one Godel found: Godel's Incompleteness Theorem. What the"
"668","Theorem states and how it is proved are two different things. We shall discuss both in"
"669","quite some detail in this book. The Theorem can De likened to a pearl, and the method of"
"670","proof to an oyster. The pearl is prized for its luster and simplicity; the oyster is a complex"
"671","living beast whose innards give rise to this mysteriously simple gem."
"672","   Godel's Theorem appears as Proposition VI in his 1931 paper ""On Formally"
"673","Undecidable Propositions in Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I."" It states:"
"674","     To every w-consistent recursive class K of formulae there correspond recursive"
"675","     class-signs r, such that neither v Gen r nor Neg (v Gen r) belongs to Fig (K) (where v"
"676","     is the free variable of r)."
"677","Actually, it was in German, and perhaps you feel that it might as well be in German"
"678","anyway. So here is a paraphrase in more normal English:"
"679","     All consistent axiomatic formulations of number theory"
"680","     include undecidable propositions."
"681","This is the pearl."
"682","   In this pearl it is hard to see a Strange Loop. That is because the Strange Loop is buried"
"683","in the oyster-the proof. The proof of Godel's Incompleteness Theorem hinges upon the"
"684","writing of a self-referential mathematical statement, in the same way as the Epimenides"
"685","paradox is a self-referential statement of language. But whereas it is very simple to talk"
"686","about language in language, it is not at all easy to see how a statement about numbers can"
"687","talk about itself. In fact, it took genius merely to connect the idea of self-referential"
"688","statements with number theory. Once Godel had the intuition that such a statement could"
"689","be created, he was over the major hurdle. The actual creation of the statement was the"
"690","working out of this one beautiful spark of intuition."
"691","Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering                                                       25"

"693","We shall examine the Godel construction quite carefully in Chapters to come, but so that"
"694","you are not left completely in the dark, I will sketch here, in a few strokes, the core of the"
"695","idea, hoping that what you see will trigger ideas in your mind. First of all, the difficulty"
"696","should be made absolutely clear. Mathematical statements-let us concentrate on number-"
"697","theoretical ones-are about properties of whole numbers. Whole numbers are not"
"698","statements, nor are their properties. A statement of number theory is not about a."
"699","statement of number theory; it just is a statement of number theory. This is the problem;"
"700","but Godel realized that there was more here than meets the eye."
"701","  Godel had the insight that a statement of number theory could be about a statement of"
"702","number theory (possibly even itself), if only numbers could somehow stand for"
"703","statements. The idea of a code, in other words, is at the heart of his construction. In the"
"704","Godel Code, usually called ""Godel-numbering"", numbers are made to stand for symbols"
"705","and sequences of symbols. That way, each statement of number theory, being a sequence"
"706","of specialized symbols, acquires a Godel number, something like a telephone number or a"
"707","license plate, by which it can be referred to. And this coding trick enables statements of"
"708","number theory to be understood on two different levels: as statements of number theory,"
"709","and also as statements about statements of number theory."
"710","  Once Godel had invented this coding scheme, he had to work out in detail a way of"
"711","transporting the Epimenides paradox into a numbertheoretical formalism. His final"
"712","transplant of Epimenides did not say, ""This statement of number theory is false"", but"
"713","rather, ""This statement of number theory does not have any proof"". A great deal of"
"714","confusion can be caused by this, because people generally understand the notion of"
"715","""proof"" rather vaguely. In fact, Godel's work was just part of a long attempt by"
"716","mathematicians to explicate for themselves what proofs are. The important thing to keep"
"717","in mind is that proofs are demonstrations within fixed systems of propositions. In the case"
"718","of Godel's work, the fixed system of numbertheoretical reasoning to which the word"
"719","""proof"" refers is that of Principia Mathematica (P.M.), a giant opus by Bertrand Russell"
"720","and Alfred North Whitehead, published between 1910 and 1913. Therefore, the Godel"
"721","sentence G should more properly be written in English as:"
"722","      This statement of number theory does not have any proof in the system of Principia"
"723","      Mathematica."
"724","Incidentally, this Godel sentence G is not Godel's Theorem-no more than the Epimenides"
"725","sentence is the observation that ""The Epimenides sentence is a paradox."" We can now"
"726","state what the effect of discovering G is. Whereas the Epimenides statement creates a"
"727","paradox since it is neither true nor false, the Godel sentence G is unprovable (inside"
"728","P.M.) but true. The grand conclusion% That the system of Principia Mathematica is"
"729","""incomplete""-there are true statements of number theory which its methods of proof are"
"730","too weak to demonstrate."

"732",""
"733","  But if Principia Mathematica was the first victim of this stroke, it was certainly not the"
"734","last! The phrase ""and Related Systems"" in the title of Godel's article is a telling one: for if"
"735","Godel's result had merely pointed out a defect in the work of Russell and Whitehead, then"
"736","others could have been inspired to improve upon P.M. and to outwit Godel's Theorem."
"737","But this was not possible: Godel's proof pertained to any axiomatic system which"
"738","purported to achieve the aims which Whitehead and Russell had set for themselves. And"
"739","for each different system, one basic method did the trick. In short, Godel showed that"
"740","provability is a weaker notion than truth, no matter what axiomatic system is involved."
"741","  Therefore Godel's Theorem had an electrifying effect upon logicians, mathematicians,"
"742","and philosophers interested in the foundations of mathematics, for it showed that no fixed"

"744","numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, ... Modern readers may not be as nonplussed by this as readers of"

"755","processes of reasoning. Now our ability to reason has often been claimed to be what"
"756","distinguishes us from other species; so it seems somewhat paradoxical, on first thought,"
"757","to mechanize that which is most human. Yet even the ancient Greeks knew that reasoning"
"758","is a patterned process, and is at least partially governed by statable laws. Aristotle"
"759","codified syllogisms, and Euclid codified geometry; but thereafter, many centuries had to"
"760","pass before progress in the study of axiomatic reasoning would take place again."
"761","  One of the significant discoveries of nineteenth-century mathematics was that there are"
"762","different, and equally valid, geometries-where by ""a geometry"" is meant a theory of"
"763","properties of abstract points and lines. It had long been assumed that geometry was what"
"764","Euclid had codified, and that, although there might be small flaws in Euclid's"
"765","presentation, they were unimportant and any real progress in geometry would be"
"766","achieved by extending Euclid. This idea was shattered by the roughly simultaneous"
"767","discovery of non-Euclidean geometry by several people-a discovery that shocked the"
"768","mathematics community, because it deeply challenged the idea that mathematics studies"
"769","the real world. How could there be many differ"

"772","ent kinds of ""points"" and ""lines"" in one single reality? Today, the solution to the dilemma"
"773","may be apparent, even to some nonmathematicians-but at the time, the dilemma created"
"774","havoc in mathematical circles."
"775","  Later in the nineteenth century, the English logicians George Boole and Augustus De"
"776","Morgan went considerably further than Aristotle in codifying strictly deductive reasoning"
"777","patterns. Boole even called his book ""The Laws of Thought""-surely an exaggeration, but"
"778","it was an important contribution. Lewis Carroll was fascinated by these mechanized"
"779","reasoning methods, and invented many puzzles which could be solved with them. Gottlob"
"780","Frege in Jena and Giuseppe Peano in Turin worked on combining formal reasoning with"
"781","the study of sets and numbers. David Hilbert in Gottingen worked on stricter"
"782","formalizations of geometry than Euclid's. All of these efforts were directed towards"
"783","clarifying what one means by ""proof""."
"784","   In the meantime, interesting developments were taking place in classical mathematics."
"785","A theory of different types of infinities, known as the theory of sets, was developed by"
"786","Georg Cantor in the 1880's. The theory was powerful and beautiful, but intuition-defying."
"787","Before long, a variety of set-theoretical paradoxes had been unearthed. The situation was"
"788","very disturbing, because just as mathematics seemed to be recovering from one set of"
"789","paradoxes-those related to the theory of limits, in the calculusalong came a whole new"
"790","set, which looked worse!"
"791","   The most famous is Russell's paradox. Most sets, it would seem, are not members of"
"792","themselves-for example, the set of walruses is not a walrus, the set containing only Joan"
"793","of Arc is not Joan of Arc (a set is not a person)-and so on. In this respect, most sets are"
"794","rather ""run-of-the-mill"". However, some ""self-swallowing"" sets do contain themselves as"
"795","members, such as the set of all sets, or the set of all things except Joan of Arc, and so on."
"796","Clearly, every set is either run-of-the-mill or self-swallowing, and no set can be both."
"797","Now nothing prevents us from inventing R: the set of all run-o,-the-mill sets. At first, R"
"798","might seem a rather run-of-the-mill invention-but that opinion must be revised when you"
"799","ask yourself, ""Is R itself ""a run-of-the-mill set or a self-swallowing set?"" You will find"
"800","that the answer is: ""R is neither run-of-the-mill nor self-swallowing, for either choice"
"801","leads to paradox."" Try it!"
"802","   But if R is neither run-of-the-mill nor self-swallowing, then what is it? At the very"
"803","least, pathological. But no one was satisfied with evasive answers of that sort. And so"
"804","people began to dig more deeply into the foundations of set theory. The crucial questions"
"805","seemed to be: ""What is wrong with our intuitive concept of 'set'? Can we make a rigorous"
"806","theory of sets which corresponds closely with our intuitions, but which skirts the"
"807","paradoxes?"" Here, as in number theory and geometry, the problem is in trying to line up"
"808","intuition with formalized, or axiomatized, reasoning systems."
"809","   A startling variant of Russell's paradox, called ""Grelling's paradox"", can be made using"
"810","adjectives instead of sets. Divide the adjectives in English into two categories: those"
"811","which are self-descriptive, such as ""pentasyllabic"", ""awkwardnessful"", and ""recherche"","
"812","and those which are not, such"
"813","Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering                                                   28"
"814",""
"815","as ""edible"", ""incomplete"", and ""bisyllabic"". Now if we admit ""non-selfdescriptive"" as an"
"816","adjective, to which class does it belong? If it seems questionable to include hyphenated"
"817","words, we can use two terms invented specially for this paradox: autological (= ""self-"
"818","descriptive""), and heterological (= ""non-self-descriptive""). The question then becomes:"
"819","""Is 'heterological' heterological?"" Try it!"
"820","  There seems to he one common culprit in these paradoxes, namely self-reference, or"
"821","""Strange Loopiness"". So if the goal is to ban all paradoxes, why not try banning self-"
"822","reference and anything that allows it to arise? This is not so easy as it might seem,"
"823","because it can be hard to figure out just where self-reference is occurring. It may be"
"824","spread out over a whole Strange Loop with several steps, as in this ""expanded"" version of"
"825","Epimenides, reminiscent of Drawing Hands:"
"826","                                 The following sentence is false."
"827","                                 The preceding sentence is true."
"828"," Taken together, these sentences have the same effect as the original Epimenides paradox:"
"829","yet separately, they are harmless and even potentially useful sentences. The ""blame"" for"
"830","this Strange Loop can't he pinned on either sentence-only on the way they ""point"" at each"
"831","other. In the same way, each local region of Ascending and Descending is quite"
"832","legitimate; it is only the way they are globally put together that creates an impossibility."
"833","Since there are indirect as well as direct ways of achieving self-reference, one must figure"
"834","out how to ban both types at once-if one sees selfreference as the root of all evil."
"835","Banishing Strange Loops"
"836"," Russell and Whitehead did subscribe to this view, and accordingly, Principia"
"837","Mathematica was a mammoth exercise in exorcising Strange Loops from logic, set"
"838","theory, and number theory. The idea of their system was basically this. A set of the"
"839","lowest ""type"" could contain only ""objects"" as membersnot sets. A set of the next type up"
"840","could only contain objects, or sets of the lowest type. In general, a set of a given type"
"841","could only contain sets of lower type, or objects. Every set would belong to a specific"
"842","type. Clearly, no set could contain itself because it would have to belong to a type higher"
"843","than its own type. Only ""run-of'-the-mill"" sets exist in such a system; furthermore, old R-"
"844","the set of all run-of-the-mill sets-no longer is considered a set at all, because it does not"
"845","belong to any finite type. To all appearances, then, this theory of types, which we might"
"846","also call the ""theory of the abolition of Strange Loops"", successfully rids set theory of its"
"847","paradoxes, but only at the cost of introducing an artificial-seeming hierarchy, and of"
"848","disallowing the formation of certain kinds of sets-such as the set of all run-of-the-mill"
"849","sets. Intuitively, this is not the way we imagine sets."

"854","interest went no further than set theory, this was quite adequate-but for people interested"
"855","in the elimination of paradoxes generally, some similar ""hierarchization"" seemed"
"856","necessary, to forbid looping back inside language. At the bottom of such a hierarchy"
"857","would be an object language. Here, reference could be made only to a specific domain-"
"858","not to aspects of the object language itself (such as its grammatical rules, or specific"
"859","sentences in it). For that purpose there would be a metalanguage. This experience of two"
"860","linguistic levels is familiar to all learners of foreign languages. Then there would be a"
"861","metametalanguage for discussing the metalanguage, and so on. It would be required that"
"862","every sentence should belong to some precise level of the hierarchy. Therefore, if one"
"863","could find no level in which a given utterance fit, then the utterance would be deemed"
"864","meaningless, and forgotten."
"865","  An analysis can be attempted on the two-step Epimenides loop given above. The first"
"866","sentence, since it speaks of the second, must be on a higher level than the second. But by"
"867","the same token, the second sentence must be on a higher level than the first. Since this is"
"868","impossible, the two sentences are ""meaningless"". More precisely, such sentences simply"
"869","cannot be formulated at all in a system based on a strict hierarchy of languages. This"
"870","prevents all versions of the Epimenides paradox as well as Grelling's paradox. (To what"
"871","language level could ""heterological"" belong?)"
"872","   Now in set theory, which deals with abstractions that we don't use all the time, a"
"873","stratification like the theory of types seems acceptable, even if a little strange-but when it"
"874","comes to language, an all-pervading part of life, such stratification appears absurd. We"
"875","don't think of ourselves as jumping up and down a hierarchy of languages when we speak"
"876","about various things. A rather matter-of-fact sentence such as, ""In this book, I criticize"
"877","the theory of types"" would be doubly forbidden in the system we are discussing. Firstly, it"
"878","mentions ""this book"", which should only be mentionable in a"
"879"," metabook""-and secondly, it mentions me-a person whom I should not be allowed to"
"880","speak of at all! This example points out how silly the theory of types seems, when you"
"881","import it into a familiar context. The remedy it adopts for paradoxes-total banishment of"
"882","self-reference in any form-is a real case of overkill, branding many perfectly good"
"883","constructions as meaningless. The adjective ""meaningless"", by the way, would have to"
"884","apply to all discussions of the theory of linguistic types (such as that of this very"

"886","nor metalanguage, nor metametalanguage, etc. So the very act of discussing the theory"
"887","would be the most blatant possible violation of it!"
"888","   Now one could defend such theories by saying that they were only intended to deal"
"889","with formal languages-not with ordinary, informal language. This may be so, but then it"
"890","shows that such theories are extremely academic and have little to say about paradoxes"
"891","except when they crop up in special tailor-made systems. Besides, the drive to eliminate"

"899","  These types of issues in the foundations of mathematics were responsible for the high"
"900","interest in codifying human reasoning methods which was present in the early part of this"
"901","century. Mathematicians and philosophers had begun to have serious doubts about"

"904","theory-a theory whose basic concept, that of a set, is surely very intuitively appealing-"
"905","then might they not also exist in other branches of mathematics? Another related worry"
"906","was that the paradoxes of logic, such as the Epimenides paradox, might turn out to be"
"907","internal to mathematics, and thereby cast in doubt all of mathematics. This was especially"
"908","worrisome to those-and there were a good number-who firmly believed that mathematics"
"909","is simply a branch of logic (or conversely, that logic is simply a branch of mathematics)."
"910","In fact, this very question-""Are mathematics and logic distinct, or separate%""-was the"
"911","source of much controversy."
"912","   This study of mathematics itself became known as metamathematics-or occasionally,"
"913","metalogic, since mathematics and logic are so intertwined. The most urgent priority of"
"914","metamathematicians was to determine the true nature of mathematical reasoning. What is"
"915","a legal method of procedure, and what is an illegal one? Since mathematical reasoning"
"916","had always been done in ""natural language"" (e.g., French or Latin or some language for"
"917","normal communication), there was always a lot of possible ambiguity. Words had"
"918","different meanings to different people, conjured up different images, and so forth. It"
"919","seemed reasonable and even important to establish a single uniform notation in which all"
"920","mathematical work could be done, and with the aid of which any two mathematicians"
"921","could resolve disputes over whether a suggested proof was valid or not. This would"
"922","require a complete codification of the universally acceptable modes of human reasoning,"
"923","at least as far as they applied to mathematics."
"924","                      Consistency, Completeness, Hilbert's Program"
"925","This was the goal of Principia Mathematica, which purported to derive all of mathematics"
"926","from logic, and, to be sure, without contradictions! It was widely admired, but no one"
"927","was sure if (1) all of mathematics really was contained in the methods delineated by"

"939","be derived within the framework drawn up in P.M.). This was a tall order, and one could"
"940","criticize it on the grounds that it was somewhat circular: how can you justify your"
"941","methods of reasoning on the basis of those same methods of reasoning? It is like lifting"
"942","yourself up by your own bootstraps. (We just don't seem to be able to get away from"
"943","these Strange Loops!)"
"944","   Hilbert was fully aware of this dilemma, of course, and therefore expressed the hope"
"945","that a demonstration of consistency or completeness could be found which depended only"
"946","on ""finitistic"" modes of reasoning. ""these were a small set of reasoning methods usually"
"947","accepted by mathematicians. In this way, Hilbert hoped that mathematicians could"
"948","partially lift themselves by their own bootstraps: the sum total of mathematical methods"
"949","might be proved sound, by invoking only a smaller set of methods. This goal may sound"
"950","rather esoteric, but it occupied the minds of many of the greatest mathematicians in the"
"951","world during the first thirty years of this century."
"952","   In the thirty-first year, however, Godel published his paper, which in some ways"
"953","utterly demolished Hilbert's program. This paper revealed not only that there were"
"954","irreparable ""holes"" in the axiomatic system proposed by Russell and Whitehead, but more"
"955","generally, that no axiomatic system whatsoever could produce all number-theoretical"
"956","truths, unless it were an inconsistent system! And finally, the hope of proving the"
"957","consistency of a system such as that presented in P.M. was shown to be vain: if such a"
"958","proof could be found using only methods inside P.M., then-and this is one of the most"
"959","mystifying consequences of Godel's work-P.M. itself would be inconsistent!"
"960","   The final irony of it all is that the proof of Gi del's Incompleteness Theorem involved"

"962","supposedly invulnerable to the attacks of Strange Loops! Although Godel's Strange Loop"

"982","   His first machine, the ""Difference Engine"", could generate mathematical tables of"
"983","many kinds by the ""method of differences"". But before any model of the ""D.E."" had been"

"985","Engine"". Rather immodestly, he wrote, ""The course through which I arrived at it was the"
"986","most entangled and perplexed which probably ever occupied the human mind.""' Unlike"
"987","any previously designed machine, the A.E. was to possess both a ""store"" (memory) and a"

"989","of intricate geared cylinders interlocked in incredibly complex ways. Babbage had a"
"990","vision of numbers swirling in and out of the mill tinder control of a program contained in"

"992","amazingly complex patterns. Babbage's brilliant but ill-fated Countess friend, Lady Ada"

"994","weaves algebraic patterns just as the Jacquard-loom weaves flowers and leaves."""
"995","Unfortunately, her use of the present tense was misleading, for no A.E. was ever built,"
"996","and Babbage died a bitterly disappointed man."
"997","   Lady Lovelace, no less than Babbage, was profoundly aware that with the invention of"

"1289","                                        Formal Systems"
"1290","ONE OF THE most central notions in this book is that of a formal system. The type of"
"1291","formal system I use was invented by the American logician Emil Post in the 1920's, and"
"1292","is often called a ""Post production system"". This Chapter introduces you to a formal"
"1293","system and moreover, it is my hope that you will want to explore this formal system at"
"1294","least a little; so to provoke your curiosity, I have posed a little puzzle."
"1295","         ""Can you produce MU?"" is the puzzle. To begin with, you will be supplied with a"
"1296","string (which means a string of letters).* Not to keep you in suspense, that string will be"
"1297","MI. Then you will be told some rules, with which you can change one string into another."
"1298","If one of those rules is applicable at some point, and you want to use it, you may, but-"
"1299","there is nothing that will dictate which rule you should use, in case there are several"
"1300","applicable rules. That is left up to you-and of course, that is where playing the game of"
"1301","any formal system can become something of an art. The major point, which almost"
"1302","doesn't need stating, is that you must not do anything which is outside the rules. We"
"1303","might call this restriction the ""Requirement of Formality"". In the present Chapter, it"
"1304","probably won't need to be stressed at all. Strange though it may sound, though, I predict"
"1305","that when you play around with some of the formal systems of Chapters to come, you"
"1306","will find yourself violating the Requirement of Formality over and over again, unless you"
"1307","have worked with formal systems before."
"1308","         The first thing to say about our formal system-the MIU-system-is that it utilizes"
"1309","only three letters of the alphabet: M, I, U. That means that the only strings of the MIU-"
"1310","system are strings which are composed of those three letters. Below are some strings of"
"1311","the MIU-system:"
"1312","                                    MU"
"1313","                                    UIM"

"1316","* In this book, we shall employ the following conventions when we refer to strings. When the"
"1317","string is in the same typeface as the text, then it will be enclosed in single or double quotes."
"1318","Punctuation which belongs to the sentence and not to the string under discussion will go outside"
"1319","of the quotes, as logic dictates. For example, the first letter of this sentence is 'F', while the first"
"1320","letter of 'this ‘sentence’.is 't'. When the string is in Quadrata Roman, however, quotes will"
"1321","usually be left off, unless clarity demands them. For example, the first letter of Quadrata is Q."
"1322","The MU-puzzle                                                                                        41"
"1323",""
"1324","But although all of these are legitimate strings, they are not strings which are ""in your"
"1325","possession"". In fact, the only string in your possession so far is MI. Only by using the"
"1326","rules, about to be introduced, can you enlarge your private collection. Here is the first"
"1327","rule:"
"1328","RULE I: If you possess a string whose last letter is I, you can add on a U at the end."
"1329","By the way, if up to this point you had not guessed it, a fact about the meaning of ""string"""
"1330","is that the letters are in a fixed order. For example, MI and IM are two different strings."
"1331","A string of symbols is not just a ""bag"" of symbols, in which the order doesn't make any"
"1332","difference."
"1333","         Here is the second rule:"
"1334","RULE II: Suppose you have Mx. Then you may add Mxx to your collection."
"1335","What I mean by this is shown below, in a few examples."
"1336","From MIU, you may get MIUIU."
"1337","From MUM, you may get MUMUM."
"1338","From MU, you may get MUU."
"1339","So the letter `x' in the rule simply stands for any string; but once you have decided which"
"1340","string it stands for, you have to stick with your choice (until you use the rule again, at"
"1341","which point you may make a new choice). Notice the third example above. It shows how,"
"1342","once you possess MU, you can add another string to your collection; but you have to get"
"1343","MU first! I want to add one last comment about the letter `x': it is not part of the formal"
"1344","system in the same way as the three letters `M', `I', and `U' are. It is useful for us,"
"1345","though, to have some way to talk in general about strings of the system, symbolically-and"
"1346","that is the function of the `x': to stand for an arbitrary string. If you ever add a string"
"1347","containing an 'x' to your ""collection"", you have done something wrong, because strings of"
"1348","the MIU-system never contain ""x"" “s”!"
"1349","Here is the third rule:"
"1350","RULE III: If III occurs in one of the strings in your collection, you may make a new"
"1351","string with U in place of III."
"1352","Examples:"
"1353","      From UMIIIMU, you could make UMUMU."
"1354","      From MII11, you could make MIU (also MUI)."

"1365","RULE IV: If UU occurs inside one of your strings, you can drop it."
"1366","From UUU, get U."
"1367","From MUUUIII, get MUIII."

"1372","The answer to the MU-puzzle appears later in the book. For now, what important is not"
"1373","finding the answer, but looking for it. You probably hay made some attempts to produce"
"1374","MU. In so doing, you have built up your own private collection of strings. Such strings,"
"1375","producible by the rules, are called theorems. The term ""theorem"" has, of course, a"
"1376","common usage mathematics which is quite different from this one. It means some"
"1377","statement in ordinary language which has been proven to be true by a rigorous argument,"
"1378","such as Zeno's Theorem about the ""unexistence"" of motion, c Euclid's Theorem about the"
"1379","infinitude of primes. But in formal system theorems need not be thought of as statements-"
"1380","they are merely strings c symbols. And instead of being proven, theorems are merely"
"1381","produced, as if F machine, according to certain typographical rules. To emphasize this"
"1382","important distinction in meanings for the word ""theorem"", I will adopt the following"
"1383","convention in this book: when ""theorem"" is capitalized, its meaning will be the everyday"
"1384","one-a Theorem is a statement in ordinary language which somebody once proved to be"
"1385","true by some sort of logic argument. When uncapitalized, ""theorem"" will have its"
"1386","technical meaning a string producible in some formal system. In these terms, the MU-"
"1387","puzzle asks whether MU is a theorem of the MIU-system."
"1388","I gave you a theorem for free at the beginning, namely MI. Such ""free"" theorem is called"
"1389","an axiom-the technical meaning again being qui different from the usual meaning. A"
"1390","formal system may have zero, or several, or even infinitely many axioms. Examples of all"
"1391","these types v appear in the book."
"1392","Every formal system has symbol-shunting rules, such as the four rules of the MIU-"
"1393","system. These rules are called either rules of production or rules of inference. I will use"
"1394","both terms."

"1408","modeled on that of proof, but a derivation is an austere cousin of a proof. It would sound"
"1409","strange to say that you had proven MUIIU, but it does not sound so strange to say you"
"1410","have derived MUIIU."
"1411","                            Inside and Outside the System"
"1412","Most people go about the MU-puzzle by deriving a number of theorems, quite at random,"
"1413","just to see what kind of thing turns up. Pretty soon, they begin to notice some properties"
"1414","of the theorems they have made; that is where human intelligence enters the picture. For"
"1415","instance, it was probably not obvious to you that all theorems would begin with M, until"
"1416","you had tried a few. Then, the pattern emerged, and not only could you see the pattern,"
"1417","but you could understand it by looking at the rules, which have the property that they"
"1418","make each new theorem inherit its first letter from an earlier theorem; ultimately, then, all"
"1419","theorems' first letters can be traced back to the first letter of the sole axiom MI-and that is"
"1420","a proof that theorems of the MIU-system must all begin with M."
"1421","         There is something very significant about what has happened here. It shows one"
"1422","difference between people and machines. It would certainly be possible-in fact it would"
"1423","be very easy-to program a computer to generate theorem after theorem of the MIU-"
"1424","system; and we could include in the program a command to stop only upon generating U."
"1425","You now know that a computer so programmed would never stop. And this does not"
"1426","amaze you. But what if you asked a friend to try to generate U? It would not surprise you"
"1427","if he came back after a while, complaining that he can't get rid of the initial M, and"
"1428","therefore it is a wild goose chase. Even if a person is not very bright, he still cannot help"
"1429","making some observations about what he is doing, and these observations give him good"
"1430","insight into the task-insight which the computer program, as we have described it, lacks."
"1431","         Now let me be very explicit about what I meant by saying this shows a difference"

"1526","An observation about this puzzle is that it involves rules of two opposite tendencies-the"
"1527","lengthening rules and the shortening rules. Two rules (I and II) allow you to increase the"
"1528","size of strings (but only in very rigid, pr scribed ways, of course); and two others allow"
"1529","you to shrink strings somewhat (again in very rigid ways). There seems to be an endless"
"1530","variety to the order in which these different types of rules might be applied, and this gives"
"1531","hope that one way or another, MU could be produced. It might involve lengthening the"
"1532","string to some gigantic size, and then extracting piece after piece until only two symbols"
"1533","are left; or, worse yet, it might involve successive stages of lengthening and then"
"1534","shortening and then lengthening and then shortening, and so on. But there is no guarantee"
"1535","it. As a matter of fact, we already observed that U cannot be produced at all and it will"
"1536","make no difference if you lengthen and shorten till kingdom come."
"1537","        Still, the case of U and the case of MU seem quite different. It is by very"
"1538","superficial feature of U that we recognize the impossibility of producing it: it doesn't"
"1539","begin with an M (whereas all theorems must). It is very convenient to have such a simple"
"1540","way to detect nontheorems. However who says that that test will detect all nontheorems?"
"1541","There may be lots strings which begin with M but are not producible. Maybe MU is one"
"1542","of them. That would mean that the ""first-letter test"" is of limited usefulness able only to"
"1543","detect a portion of the nontheorems, but missing others. B there remains the possibility of"
"1544","some more elaborate test which discriminates perfectly between those strings which can"
"1545","be produced by the rules and those which cannot. Here we have to face the question,"
"1546","""What do mean by a test?"" It may not be obvious why that question makes sense, of"
"1547","important, in this context. But I will give an example of a ""test"" which somehow seems to"
"1548","violate the spirit of the word."
"1549","        Imagine a genie who has all the time in the world, and who enjoys using it to"

"1552","      Step 1: Apply every applicable rule to the axiom MI. This yields two new theorems"

"1557",""
"1558","      Step 3: Apply every applicable rule to the theorems produced in step 2. This yields"
"1559","      five new theorems: MIIIIU, MIIUIIU, MIUIUIUIU, MIIIIIIII, MUI."
"1560","This method produces every single theorem sooner or later, because the rules are applied"
"1561","in every conceivable order. (See Fig. 11.) All of the lengthening-shortening alternations"
"1562","which we mentioned above eventually get carried out. However, it is not clear how long"
"1563","to wait for a given string"

"1574","This seems ridiculous, because it presupposes that we don't mind waiting around literally"

"1576","should count as a ""test"". Of prime importance is a guarantee that we will get our answer"

"1584","the rules and axioms of the formal system provide no less complete a characterization of"
"1585","the theorems of the system than a decision procedure would. The tricky word here is"
"1586","""characterization"". Certainly the rules of inference and the axioms of the MIU-system do"
"1587","characterize, implicitly, those strings that are theorems. Even more implicitly, they"
"1588","characterize those strings that are not theorems. But implicit characterization is not"
"1589","enough, for many purposes. If someone claims to have a characterization of all theorems,"
"1590","but it takes him infinitely long to deduce that some particular string is not a theorem, you"
"1591","would probably tend to say that there is something lacking in that characterization-it is"
"1592","not quite concrete enough. And that is why discovering that a decision procedure exists is"
"1593","a very important step. What the discovery means, in effect, is that you can perform a test"
"1594","for theoremhood of a string, and that, even if the test is complicated, it is guaranteed to"
"1595","terminate. In principle, the test is just as easy, just as mechanical, just as finite, just as full"
"1596","of certitude, as checking whether the first letter of the string is M. A decision procedure"
"1597","is a ""litmus test"" for theoremhood!"
"1598","         Incidentally, one requirement on formal systems is that the set of axioms must be"
"1599","characterized by a decision procedure-there must be a litmus test for axiomhood. This"
"1600","ensures that there is no problem in getting off the ground at the beginning, at least. That"

"1739","In this Chapter and the next, we will look at several new formal systems. This will give"
"1740","us a much wider perspective on the concept of formal system. By the end of these two"
"1741","Chapters, you should have quite a good idea of the power of formal systems, and why"
"1742","they are of interest to mathematicians and logicians."
"1743","                                      The pq-System"
"1744","The formal system of this Chapter is called the pq-system. It is not important to"
"1745","mathematicians or logicians-in fact, it is just a simple invention of mine. Its importance"
"1746","lies only in the fact that it provides an excellent example of many ideas that play a large"
"1747","role in this book. There are three distinct symbols of the pq-system:"
"1748","                                         p       q    -"
"1749","-the letters p, q, and the hyphen."
"1750","The pq-system has an infinite number of axioms. Since we can't write them all down, we"
"1751","have to have some other way of describing what they are. Actually, we want more than"
"1752","just a description of the axioms; we want a way to tell whether some given string is an"
"1753","axiom or not. A mere description of axioms might characterize them fully and yet"
"1754","weakly-which was the problem with the way theorems in the MIU-system were"
"1755","characterized. We don't want to have to struggle for an indeterminate-possibly infinite"
"1756","length of time, just to find out if some string is an axiom or not. Therefore, we will define"
"1757","axioms in such a way that there is an obvious decision procedure for axiomhood of a"
"1758","string composed of p's, q's, and hyphens."
"1759","Meaning and Form in Mathematics                                                            54"

"1761","DEFINITION: xp-qx is an axiom, whenever x is composed of hyphens only."
"1762","Note that 'x' must stand for the same string of hyphens in both occurrences For example, -"
"1763","-p-q---is an axiom. The literal expression `xp-qx-' i,, not an axiom, of course (because `x'"
"1764","does not belong to the pq-system); it is more like a mold in which all axioms are cast-and"
"1765","it is called an axiom schema."
"1766","         The pq-system has only one rule of production:"
"1767","RULE: Suppose x, y, and z all stand for particular strings containing only hyphens. And"
"1768","suppose that x py qz is known to be a theorem. The` xpy-qz- is a theorem."
"1769","For example, take x to be'--', y to be'---', and z to be'-'. The rule tells us:"
"1770","         If --p---q- turns out to be a theorem, then so will --p----q--."
"1771","As is typical of rules of production, the statement establishes a causal connection between"
"1772","the theoremhood of two strings, but without asserting theoremhood for either one on its"
"1773","own."
"1774","         A most useful exercise for you is to find a decision procedure for the theorems of"
"1775","the pq-system. It is not hard; if you play around for a while you will probably pick it up."
"1776","Try it."
"1777","                                  The Decision Procedure"
"1778","I presume you have tried it. First of all, though it may seem too obvious to mention, I"
"1779","would like to point out that every theorem of the pq-system has three separate groups of"
"1780","hyphens, and the separating elements are one p, and one q, in that order. (This can be"
"1781","shown by an argument based on ""heredity"", just the way one could show that all MIU-"
"1782","system theorems had to begin with M.) This means that we can rule out, from its form"
"1783","alone, o string such as --p--p--p--q ."
"1784","Now, stressing the phrase ""from its form alone"" may seem silly; what else is there to a"
"1785","string except its form? What else could possibly play a roll in determining its properties?"
"1786","Clearly nothing could. But bear this in mint as the discussion of formal systems goes on;"
"1787","the notion of ""form"" will star to get rather more complicated and abstract, and we will"
"1788","have to think more about the meaning of the word ""form"". In any case, let us give the"
"1789","name well formed string to any string which begins with a hyphen-group, then ha one p,"
"1790","then has a second hyphen-group, then a q, and then a final hyphen-group."
"1791","Back to the decision procedure ... The criterion for theoremhood is that the first two"
"1792","hyphen-groups should add up, in length, to the third"
"1793","Meaning and Form in Mathematics                                                          55"

"1795","hyphen-group. for instance, --p--q - is a theorem, since 2 plus 2 equals 4, whereas --p--q-"
"1796","is not, since 2 plus 2 is not 1. To see why this is the proper criterion, look first at the"
"1797","axiom schema. Obviously, it only manufactures axioms which satisfy the addition"
"1798","criterion. Second, look at the rule of production. If the first string satisfies the addition"
"1799","criterion, so must the second one-and conversely, if the first string does not satisfy the"
"1800","addition criterion, then neither does the second string. The rule makes the addition"
"1801","criterion into a hereditary property of theorems: any theorem passes the property on to its"
"1802","offspring. This shows why the addition criterion is correct."
"1803","        There is, incidentally, a fact about the pq-system which would enable us to say"
"1804","with confidence that it has a decision procedure, even before finding the addition"
"1805","criterion. That fact is that the pq-system is not complicated by the opposing currents of"
"1806","lengthening and shortening rules; it has only lengthening rules. Any formal system which"
"1807","tells you how to make longer theorems from shorter ones, but never the reverse, has got"
"1808","to have a decision procedure for its theorems. For suppose you are given a string. First"
"1809","check whether it's an axiom or not (I am assuming that there is a decision procedure for"
"1810","axiomhood-otherwise, things are hopeless). If it is an axiom, then it is by definition a"
"1811","theorem, and the test is over. So suppose instead that it's not an axiom. Then, to be a"
"1812","theorem, it must have come from a shorter string, via one of the rules. By going over the"
"1813","various rules one by one, you can pinpoint not only the rules that could conceivably"
"1814","produce that string, but also exactly which shorter strings could be its forebears on the"
"1815","""family tree"". In this way, you ""reduce"" the problem to determining whether any of"
"1816","several new but shorter strings is a theorem. Each of them can in turn be subjected to the"
"1817","same test. The worst that can happen is a proliferation of more and more, but shorter and"
"1818","shorter, strings to test. As you continue inching your way backwards in this fashion, you"
"1819","must be getting closer to the source of all theorems-the axiom schemata. You just can't"
"1820","get shorter and shorter indefinitely; therefore, eventually either you will find that one of"
"1821","your short strings is an axiom, or you'll come to a point where you're stuck, in that none"
"1822","of your short strings is an axiom, and none of them can be further shortened by running"
"1823","some rule or other backwards. This points out that there really is not much deep interest"
"1824","in formal systems with lengthening rules only; it is the interplay of lengthening and"
"1825","shortening rules that gives formal systems a certain fascination.."
"1826","                               Bottom-up vs. Top-down"
"1827","The method above might be called a top-down decision procedure, to be contrasted with a"
"1828","bottom-up decision procedure, which I give now. It is very reminiscent of the genie's"
"1829","systematic theorem-generating method for the MIU-system, but is complicated by the"
"1830","presence of an axiom schema. We are going to form a ""bucket"" into which we throw"
"1831","theorems as they are generated. Here is how it is done:"
"1832","Meaning and Form in Mathematics                                                            56"

"1840","(3b) Apply the rule to each item in the bucket, and throw all results into the bucket."
"1841","   etc., etc."
"1842","A moment's reflection will show that you can't fail to produce every theorem of the pq-"
"1843","system this way. Moreover, the bucket is getting filled with longer and longer theorems,"
"1844","as time goes on. It is again a consequence of that lack of shortening rules. So if you have"
"1845","a particular string, such as --p---q---- , which you want to test for theoremhood, just"
"1846","follow the numbered steps, checking all the while for the string in question. If it turns up-"
"1847","theorem! If at some point everything that goes into the bucket is longer than the string in"
"1848","question, forget it-it is not a theorem. This decision procedure is bottom=up because it is"
"1849","working its way up from the basics, which is to say the axioms. The previous decision"
"1850","procedure is top-down because it does precisely the reverse: it works its way back down"
"1851","towards the basics."
"1852","                            Isomorphisms Induce Meaning"
"1853","Now we come to a central issue of this Chapter-indeed of the book. Perhaps you have"
"1854","already thought to yourself that the pq-theorems are like additions. The string --p---q--- is"
"1855","a theorem because 2 plus 3 equals 5. It could even occur to you that the theorem --p---q--"
"1856","is a statement, written in an odd notation, whose meaning is that 2 plus 3 is 5. Is this a"
"1857","reasonable way to look at things? Well, I deliberately chose 'p' to remind you of 'plus',"
"1858","and 'q' to remind you of 'equals' . . . So, does the string --p---q---- actually mean ""2 plus"
"1859","3 equals 5""?"
"1860","         What would make us feel that way? My answer would be that we have perceived"
"1861","an isomorphism between pq-theorems and additions. In the Introduction, the word"
"1862","""isomorphism"" was defined as an information preserving transformation. We can now go"
"1863","into that notion a little more deeply, and see it from another perspective. The word"
"1864","""isomorphism' applies when two complex structures can be mapped onto each other, in"
"1865","such a way that to each part of one structure there is a corresponding part in the other"
"1866","structure, where ""corresponding"" means that the two part play similar roles in their"
"1867","respective structures. This usage of the word ""isomorphism"" is derived from a more"
"1868","precise notion in mathematics."
"1869","Meaning and Form in Mathematics                                                            57"

"1874","significant advance in knowledge-and I claim that it is such perceptions of isomorphism"
"1875","which create meanings in the minds of people. A final word on the perception of"
"1876","isomorphisms: since they come in many shapes and sizes, figuratively speaking, it is not"

"1889","        Secondly, on a higher level, there is the correspondence between true statements"
"1890","and theorems. But-note carefully-this higher-level correspondence could not be perceived"
"1891","without the prior choice of an interpretation for the symbols. Thus it would be more"
"1892","accurate to describe it as a correspondence between true statements and interpreted"
"1893","theorems. In any case we have displayed a two-tiered correspondence, which is typical of"

"1895","        When you confront a formal system you know nothing of, and if you hope to"

"1898","emerges between true statements and theorems. You may make several tentative stabs in"

"1927","Such interpretations abound-any random choice a will do. For instance, take this one:"

"2585","represented positively. The intuition underlying my belief is represented by the question:"
"2586","""How could a figure and its ground not carry exactly the same information?"" They"
"2587","seemed to me to embody the same information, just coded in two complementary ways."
"2588","What seems right to you?"
"2589","         It turns out I was right about the primes, but wrong in general. This astonished"
"2590","me, and continues to astonish me even today. It is a fact that:"
"2591","       There exist formal systems whose negative space (set of nontheorems) is not"
"2592","       the positive space (set of theorems) of any formal system."
"2593","         This result, it turns out, is of depth equal to Gödel’s Theorem-so it is not"
"2594","surprising that my intuition was upset. I, just like the mathematicians of the early"
"2595","twentieth century, expected the world of formal systems and natural numbers to be more"
"2596","predictable than it is. In more technical terminology, this becomes:"
"2597","         There exist recursively enumerable sets which are not recursive."
"2598","The phrase recursively enumerable (often abbreviated ""r.e."") is the mathematical"
"2599","counterpart to our artistic notion of ""cursively drawable""-and recursive is the counterpart"
"2600","of ""recursive"". For a set of strings to be ""r.e."" means that it can be generated according to"
"2601","typographical rules-for example, the set of C-type theorems, the set of theorems of the"
"2602","MIU-system-indeed, the set of theorems of any formal system. This could be compared"
"2603","with the conception of a ""figure"" as ""a set of lines which can be generated according to"
"2604","artistic rules"" (whatever that might mean!). And a ""recursive set"" is like a figure whose"
"2605","ground is also a figure-not only is it r.e., but its complement is also r.e."
"2606","         It follows from the above result that:"
"2607","       There exist formal systems for which there is no typographical decision"
"2608","       procedure."
"2609","         How does this follow? Very simply. A typographical decision procedure is a"
"2610","method which tells theorems from nontheorems. The existence of such a test allows us to"
"2611","generate all nontheorems systematically, simply by going down a list of all strings and"

"2619","systems."

"2629","        We answered no to the artistic question, ""Are all figures recursive We have now"
"2630","seen that we must likewise answer no to the analogous question in mathematics: ""Are all"
"2631","sets recursive?"" With this perspective, 1 us now come back to the elusive word ""form""."
"2632","Let us take our figure-set and our ground-set G again. We can agree that all the numbers"
"2633","in set have some common ""form""-but can the same be said about numbers in s G? It is a"
"2634","strange question. When we are dealing with an infinite set to sta with-the natural"

"2639","to leave it with some intuitive fluidity."
"2640","        Here is a puzzle to think about in connection with the above matter Can you"

"2645","Finally, what about a formal system for generating primes? How is it don< The trick is to"
"2646","skip right over multiplication, and to go directly to nondivisibility as the thing to"
"2647","represent positively. Here are an axiom schema and rule for producing theorems which"
"2648","represent the notion that one number does not divide (D N D) another number exactly:"
"2649","        AXIOM SCHEMA: xy D N Dx where x and y are hyphen-strings."
"2650","        For example ----D N D--, where x has been replaced by'--'and y by ‘---“."

"2653","RULE: If x D N Dy is a theorem, then so is x D N Dx y."
"2654","If you use the rule twice, you can generate this theorem:"
"2655","                 -----D N D --------------"
"2656","which is interpreted as ""5 does not divide 12"". But ---D N D------------ is not a theorem."
"2657","What goes wrong if you try to produce it?"
"2658","         Now in order to determine that a given number is prime, we have to build up"
"2659","some knowledge about its nondivisibility properties. In particular, we want to know that"
"2660","it is not divisible by 2 or 3 or 4, etc., all the way up to 1 less than the number itself. But"
"2661","we can't be so vague in formal systems as to say ""et cetera"". We must spell things out."
"2662","We would like to have a way of saying, in the language of the system, ""the number Z is"
"2663","divisor free up to X"", meaning that no number between 2 and X divides Z. This can be"
"2664","done, but there is a trick to it. Think about it if you want."
"2665","         Here is the solution:"
"2666","RULE: If --D N D z is a theorem, so is z D F--."
"2667","RULE: If z D Fx is a theorem and also x-D N Dz is a theorem, z D Fx- is a theorem."
"2668","These two rules capture the notion of divisor freeness. All we need to do is to say that"
"2669","primes are numbers which are divisor-free up to 1 less than themselves:"
"2670","RULE: If z-DFz is a theorem, then Pz- is a theorem."
"2671","Oh-let's not forget that 2 is prime!"
"2672","Axiom: P--."
"2673","And there you have it. The principle of representing primality formally is that there is a"
"2674","test for divisibility which can be done without any backtracking. You march steadily"
"2675","upward, testing first for divisibility by 2, then by 3, and so on. It is this ""monotonicity"" or"
"2676","unidirectionality-this absence of cross-play between lengthening and shortening,"

"2926","IN CHAPTER II, we saw how meaning-at least in the relatively simple context of formal"
"2927","systems-arises when there is an isomorphism between rule-governed symbols, and things"
"2928","in the real world. The more complex the isomorphism, in general, the more ""equipment""-"
"2929","both hardware and software-is required to extract the meaning from the symbols. If an"
"2930","isomorphism is very simple (or very familiar), we are tempted to say that the meaning"
"2931","which it allows us to see is explicit. We see the meaning without seeing the isomorphism."
"2932","The most blatant example is human language, where people often attribute meaning to"
"2933","words in themselves, without being in the slightest aware of the very complex"
"2934","""isomorphism"" that imbues them with meanings. This is an easy enough error to make. It"
"2935","attributes all the meaning to the object (the word), rather than to the link between that"
"2936","object and the real world. You might compare it to the naive belief that noise is a"
"2937","necessary side effect of any collision of two objects. This is a false belief; if two objects"
"2938","collide in a vacuum, there will be no noise at all. Here again, the error stems from"
"2939","attributing the noise exclusively to the collision, and not recognizing the role of the"
"2940","medium, which carries it from the objects to the ear."
"2941","        Above, I used the word ""isomorphism"" in quotes to indicate that it must be taken"
"2942","with a grain of salt. The symbolic processes which underlie the understanding of human"
"2943","language are so much more complex than the symbolic processes in typical formal"
"2944","systems, that, if we want to continue thinking of meaning as mediated by isomorphisms,"
"2945","we shall have to adopt a far more flexible conception of what isomorphisms can be than"
"2946","we have up till now. In my opinion, in fact, the key element in answering the question"

"2957","the black marks on paper, are incredibly complex. Nevertheless, we shall consider the"
"2958","events in the story to be the explicit meaning of the Dialogue, and assume that every"

"2960","from the marks on the paper."
"2961","         Even so, I'd like to be a little more explicit about the explicit meaning of the story."
"2962","First I'll talk about the record players and the records. The main point is that there are two"

"2964","""music""-a sequence of vibrations in the air, or a succession of emotional responses in a"
"2965","brain? It is both. But before there can be emotional responses, there have to be vibrations."
"2966","Now the vibrations get ""pulled"" out of the grooves by a record player, a relatively"
"2967","straightforward device; in fact you can do it with a pin, just pulling it down the grooves."
"2968","After this stage, the ear converts the vibrations into firings of auditory neurons in the"

"2970","sequence of vibrations into a complex pattern of interacting emotional responses-far too"
"2971","complex for us to go into here, much though I would like to. Let us therefore content"
"2972","ourselves with thinking of the sounds in the air as the ""Level One"" meaning of the"
"2973","grooves."
"2974","What is the Level Two meaning of the grooves? It is the sequence of vibrations induced"
"2975","in the record player. This meaning can only arise after the Level One meaning has been"
"2976","pulled out of the grooves, since the vibrations in the air cause the vibrations in the"
"2977","phonograph. Therefore, the Level Two meaning depends upon a chain of two"
"2978","isomorphisms:"
"2979","                 (1) Isomorphism between arbitrary groove patterns and air"
"2980","                    vibrations;"

"2982","                    vibrations and phonograph vibrations"
"2983","This chain of two isomorphisms is depicted in Figure 20. Notice that isomorphism I is the"
"2984","one which gives rise to the Level One meaning. The Level Two meaning is more implicit"
"2985","than the Level One meaning, because it is mediated by the chain of two isomorphisms. It"
"2986","is the Level Two meaning which ""backfires"", causing the record player to break apart."
"2987","What is of interest is that the production of the Level One meaning forces the production"
"2988","of the Level Two meaning simultaneously-there is no way to have Level One without"
"2989","Level Two. So it was the implicit meaning of the record which turned back on it, and"
"2990","destroyed it."
"2991","         Similar comments apply to the goblet. One difference is that the mapping from"

"2993","call ""transcription"". That is followed by ""translation""-conversion of musical notes into"

"3158","for over two thousand years-one of the most enduring works of all time. Why was this"
"3159","so?"
"3160","        The principal reason was that Euclid was the founder of rigor in mathematics. The"
"3161","Elements began with very simple concepts, definitions, and so forth, and gradually built"
"3162","up a vast body of results organized in such a way that any given result depended only on"

"3166","skyscraper. (See Fig. 21.) In the latter, that it is standing is proof enough that its structural"

"3168","to follow logically from earlier propositions, there will be no visible crash if one of the"
"3169","proofs is invalid. The girders and struts are not physical, but abstract. In fact, in Euclid's"
"3170","Elements, the stuff out of which proofs were constructed was human language-that"
"3171","elusive, tricky medium of communication with so many hidden pitfalls. What, then, of"

"3209","stories. The first four postulates are rather terse and elegant:"
"3210","       (1) A straight line segment can be drawn joining any two points."
"3211","       (2) Any straight line segment can be extended indefinitely in a straight line."
"3212","       (3) Given any straight line segment, a circle can be drawn having the segment as"
"3213","              radius and one end point as center."
"3214","       (4) All right angles are congruent."
"3215","The fifth, however, did not share their grace:"
"3216","        (5) If two lines are drawn which intersect a third in such a way that the sum of the"
"3217","              inner angles on one side is less than two right angles, then the two lines"
"3218","              inevitably must intersect each other on that side if extended far enough"

"3221","Though he never explicitly said so, Euclid considered this postulate to be somehow"
"3222","inferior to the others, since he managed to avoid using it in t proofs of the first twenty-"

"3312","    line which passes through that point and never intersects the first line, no matter"
"3313","    how far they are extended."
"3314","         The second straight line is then said to be parallel to the first. If you assert that no"
"3315","such line exists, then you reach elliptical geometry; if you assert that, at east two such"
"3316","lines exist, you reach hyperbolic geometry. Incidentally, tf reason that such variations are"
"3317","still called ""geometries"" is that the cot element-absolute, or four-postulate, geometry-is"
"3318","embedded in them. is the presence of this minimal core which makes it sensible to think"
"3319","of the] as describing properties of some sort of geometrical space, even if the spa( is not"
"3320","as intuitive as ordinary space."
"3321","         Actually, elliptical geometry is easily visualized. All ""points"", ""lines and so forth"
"3322","are to be parts of the surface of an ordinary sphere. Let t write ""POINT"" when the"
"3323","technical term is meant, and ""point"" when t1 everyday sense is desired. Then, we can say"
"3324","that a POINT consists of a pa of diametrically opposed points of the sphere's surface. A"
"3325","LINE is a great circle on the sphere (a circle which, like the equator, has its center at tI"

"3331","         By treating words such as ""POINT"" and ""LINE"" as if they had only tt meaning"

"3371","exactly what is meant by consistency of a formal system (together with an interpretation):"
"3372","that every theorem, when interpreted, becomes a true statement. And we will say that"
"3373","inconsistency occurs when there is at least one false statement among the interpreted"
"3374","theorems."
"3375","        This definition appears to be talking about inconsistency with the external world-"
"3376","what about internal inconsistencies? Presumably, a system would be internally"
"3377","inconsistent if it contained two or more theorems whose interpretations were"
"3378","incompatible with one another, and internally consistent if all interpreted theorems were"
"3379","compatible with one another. Consider, for example, a formal system which has only the"
"3380","following three theorems: TbZ, ZbE, and EbT. If T is interpreted as ""the Tortoise"", Z as"
"3381","""Zeno"", E as ""Egbert"", and x by as ""x beats y in chess always"", then we have the"
"3382","following interpreted theorems:"

"3388","The statements are not incompatible, although they describe a rather bizarre circle of"
"3389","chess players. Hence, under this interpretation, the form; system in which those three"
"3390","strings are theorems is internally consistent although, in point of fact, none of the three"
"3391","statements is true! Intern< consistency does not require all theorems to come out true, but"
"3392","merely that they come out compatible with one another."
"3393","         Now suppose instead that x by is to be interpreted as ""x was invented by y"". Then"

"4464","                                  What Is Recursion?"
"4465","WHAT IS RECURSION? It is what was illustrated in the Dialogue Little Harmonic"
"4466","Labyrinth: nesting, and variations on nesting. The concept is very general. (Stories inside"
"4467","stories, movies inside movies, paintings inside paintings, Russian dolls inside Russian"
"4468","dolls (even parenthetical comments in. side parenthetical comments!)-these are just a few"
"4469","of the charms of recursion.) However, you should he aware that the meaning of"
"4470","""recursive' in this Chapter is only faintly related to its meaning in Chapter 111. The"
"4471","relation should be clear by the end of this Chapter."
"4472","        Sometimes recursion seems to brush paradox very closely. For example, there are"
"4473","recursive definitions. Such a definition may give the casual viewer the impression that"
"4474","something is being defined in terms of itself. That would be circular and lead to infinite"
"4475","regress, if not to paradox proper. Actually, a recursive definition (when properly"
"4476","formulated) never leads to infinite regress or paradox. This is because a recursive"
"4477","definition never defines something in terms of itself, but always in terms of simpler"
"4478","versions of itself. What I mean by this will become clearer shortly, when ' show some"
"4479","examples of recursive definitions."
"4480","        One of the most common ways in which recursion appears in daily life is when"
"4481","you postpone completing a task in favor of a simpler task, often o the same type. Here is"
"4482","a good example. An executive has a fancy telephone and receives many calls on it. He is"
"4483","talking to A when B calls. To A he say,, ""Would you mind holding for a moment?"" Of"
"4484","course he doesn't really car if A minds; he just pushes a button, and switches to B. Now C"
"4485","calls. The same deferment happens to B. This could go on indefinitely, but let us not get"
"4486","too bogged down in our enthusiasm. So let's say the call with C terminates. Then our"
"4487","executive ""pops"" back up to B, and continues. Meanwhile A is sitting at the other end of"
"4488","the line, drumming his fingernails again some table, and listening to some horrible"
"4489","Muzak piped through the phone lines to placate him ... Now the easiest case is if the call"
"4490","with B simply terminates, and the executive returns to A finally. But it could happen that"
"4491","after the conversation with B is resumed, a new caller-D-calls. B is once again pushed"
"4492","onto the stack of waiting callers, and D is taken care of. Aft D is done, back to B, then"
"4493","back to A. This executive is hopelessly mechanical, to be sure-but we are illustrating"
"4494","recursion in its most precise form"
"4495","Recursive Structures and Processes                                                     135"
"4496",""
"4497","                              Pushing, Popping, and Stacks"
"4498","In the preceding example, I have introduced some basic terminology of recursion-at least"
"4499","as seen through the eyes of computer scientists. The terms are push, pop, and stack (or"
"4500","push-down stack, to be precise) and they are all related. They were introduced in the late"
"4501","1950's as part of IPL, one of the first languages for Artificial Intelligence. You have"
"4502","already encountered ""push"" and ""pop"" in the Dialogue. But I will spell things out"
"4503","anyway. To push means to suspend operations on the task you're currently working on,"
"4504","without forgetting where you are-and to take up a new task. The new task is usually said"
"4505","to be ""on a lower level"" than the earlier task. To pop is the reverse-it means to close"
"4506","operations on one level, and to resume operations exactly where you left off, one level"
"4507","higher."
"4508","         But how do you remember exactly where you were on each different level? The"
"4509","answer is, you store the relevant information in a stack. So a stack is just a table telling"
"4510","you such things as (1) where you were in each unfinished task (jargon: the ""return"
"4511","address""), (2) what the relevant facts to know were at the points of interruption (jargon:"
"4512","the ""variable bindings""). When you pop back up to resume some task, it is the stack"
"4513","which restores your context, so you don't feel lost. In the telephone-call example, the"
"4514","stack tells you who is waiting on each different level, and where you were in the"
"4515","conversation when it was interrupted."
"4516","         By the way, the terms ""push"", ""pop"", and ""stack"" all come from the visual image"
"4517","of cafeteria trays in a stack. There is usually some sort of spring underneath which tends"
"4518","to keep the topmost tray at a constant height, more or less. So when you push a tray onto"
"4519","the stack, it sinks a little-and when you remove a tray from the stack, the stack pops up a"
"4520","little."
"4521","         One more example from daily life. When you listen to a news report on the radio,"
"4522","oftentimes it happens that they switch you to some foreign correspondent. ""We now"
"4523","switch you to Sally Swumpley in Peafog, England."" Now Sally has got a tape of some"
"4524","local reporter interviewing someone, so after giving a bit of background, she plays it. ""I'm"
"4525","Nigel Cadwallader, here on scene just outside of Peafog, where the great robbery took"
"4526","place, and I'm talking with ..."" Now you are three levels down. It may turn out that the"
"4527","interviewee also plays a tape of some conversation. It is not too uncommon to go down"
"4528","three levels in real news reports, and surprisingly enough, we scarcely have any"
"4529","awareness of the suspension. It is all kept track of quite easily by our subconscious mind."
"4530","Probably the reason it is so easy is that each level is extremely different in flavor from"
"4531","each other level. If they were all similar, we would get confused in no time flat."
"4532","         An example of a more complex recursion is, of course, our Dialogue. There,"
"4533","Achilles and the Tortoise appeared on all the different levels. Sometimes they were"

"4576","gigue from the French Suite no. 5, which is quite typical of the form. Its tonic key is G,"
"4577","and we hear a gay dancing melody which establishes the key of G strongly. Soon,"
"4578","however, a modulation in the A-section leads to the closely related key of D (the"
"4579","dominant). When the A-section ends, we are in the key of D. In fact, it sounds as if the"
"4580","piece has ended in the key of D! (Or at least it might sound that way to Achilles.) But"
"4581","then a strange thing happens-we abruptly jump back to the beginning, back to G, and"
"4582","rehear the same transition into D. But then a strange thing happens-we abruptly jump"
"4583","back to the beginning, back to G, and rehear the same transition into D."
"4584","        Then comes the B-section. With the inversion of the theme for our melody, we"
"4585","begin in D as if that had always been the tonic-but we modulate back to G after all, which"
"4586","means that we pop back into the tonic, and the B-section ends properly. Then that funny"
"4587","repetition takes place, jerking us without warning back into D, and letting us return to G"
"4588","once more. Then that funny repetition takes place, jerking us without warning"
"4589","        back into D, and letting us return to G once more."
"4590","        The psychological effect of all this key shifting-some jerky, some smooth-is very"
"4591","difficult to describe. It is part of the magic of music that we can automatically make sense"

"4624","a diagram showing various paths which can be followed to accomplish a particular task."
"4625","Each path consists of a number of nodes, or little boxes with words in them, joined by"
"4626","arcs, or lines with arrows. The overall name for the RTN is written separately at the left,"
"4627","and the and last nodes have the words begin and end in them. All the other nodes contain"

"4631","        Let's take a sample RTN, called ORNATE NOUN, which tells how to construct"
"4632","a certain type of English noun phrase. (See Fig. 27a.) If traverse ORNATE NOUN"
"4633","purely horizontally, we begin', then we create ARTICLE, an ADJECTIVE, and a"

"4640","procedure (here, NOUN) which (1) does thing (produces a noun) and then (2) hands"

"4866","composed of many boxes, showing where the copies go, and how they are distorted. I call"
"4867","it the ""skeleton"" of INT. To construct INT from its skeleton, you do the following. First,"
"4868","for each box of the skeleton, you do two operations: (1) put a small curved copy of the"
"4869","skeleton inside the box, using the curved line inside it as a guide; (2) erase the containing"
"4870","box and its curved line. Once this has been done for each box of the original skeleton,"
"4871","you are left with many ""baby"" skeletons in place of one big one. Next you repeat the"
"4872","process one level down, with all the baby skeletons. Then again, again, and again ... What"
"4873","you approach in the limit is an exact graph of INT, though you never get there. By"
"4874","nesting the skeleton inside itself over and over again, you gradually construct the graph"
"4875","of INT ""from out of nothing"". But in fact the ""nothing"" was not nothing-it was a picture."
"4876","         To see this even more dramatically, imagine keeping the recursive part of the"
"4877","definition of INT, but changing the initial picture, the skeleton. A variant skeleton is"
"4878","shown in Figure 33b, again with boxes which get smaller and smaller as they trail off to"
"4879","the four corners. If you nest this second skeleton inside itself over and over again, you"
"4880","will create the key graph from my Ph.D. thesis, which I call Gplot (Fig. 34). (In fact,"
"4881","some complicated distortion of each copy is needed as well-but nesting is the basic idea.)."
"4882","         Gplot is thus a member of the INT-family. It is a distant relative, because its"
"4883","skeleton is quite different from-and considerably more complex than-that of INT."
"4884","However, the recursive part of the definition is identical, and therein lies the family tie."
"4885","I should not keep you too much in the dark about the origin of these beautiful graphs."
"4886","INT-standing for ""interchange""-comes from a problem involving ""Eta-sequences"", which"
"4887","are related to continued fractions. The basic idea behind INT is that plus and minus signs"
"4888","are interchanged in a certain kind of continued fraction. As a consequence, INT(INT(x))"
"4889","= x. INT has the property that if x is rational, so is INT(x); if x is quadratic, so is INT(x)."
"4890","I do not know if this trend holds for higher algebraic degrees. Another lovely feature of"
"4891","INT is that at all rational values of x, it has a jump discontinuity, but at all irrational"
"4892","values of x, it is continuous."
"4893","         Gplot comes from a highly idealized version of the question, ""What are the"
"4894","allowed energies of electrons in a crystal in a magnetic field?"" This problem is interesting"
"4895","because it is a cross between two very simple and fundamental physical situations: an"
"4896","electron in a perfect crystal, and an electron in a homogeneous magnetic field. These two"
"4897","simpler problems are both well understood, and their characteristic solutions seem almost"
"4898","incompatible with each other. Therefore, it is of quite some interest to see how nature"
"4899","manages to reconcile the two. As it happens, the crystal without-magnetic-field situation"
"4900","and the magnetic-field-without-crystal situation do have one feature in common: in each"
"4901","of them, the electron behaves periodically in time. It turns out that when the two"
"4902","situations are combined, the ratio of their two time periods is the key parameter. In fact,"
"4903","that ratio holds all the information about the distribution of allowed electron energies-but"
"4904","it only gives up its secret upon being expanded into a continued fraction."

"5087","fixed set of instructions to repeated-need not actually be completely fixed. It may vary in"
"5088","so predictable way."
"5089","         An example is the most simple-minded test for the primality o natural number N,"
"5090","in which you begin by trying to divide N by 2, then 3, 4, 5, etc. until N - 1. If N has"
"5091","survived all these tests without be divisible, it's prime. Notice that each step in the loop is"
"5092","similar to, but i the same as, each other step. Notice also that the number of steps varies"
"5093","with N-hence a loop of fixed length could never work as a general test primality. There"
"5094","are two criteria for ""aborting"" the loop: (1) if so number divides N exactly, quit with"
"5095","answer ""NO""; (2) if N - 1 is react as a test divisor and N survives, quit with answer"
"5096","""YES""."
"5097","         The general idea of loops, then, is this: perform some series of related steps over"
"5098","and over, and abort the process when specific conditions are n Now sometimes, the"
"5099","maximum number of steps in a loop will be known advance; other times, you just begin,"
"5100","and wait until it is aborted. The second type of loop -- which I call a free loop -- is"
"5101","dangerous, because criterion for abortion may never occur, leaving the computer in a so-"

"5104","""BlooP and FlooP and G1ooP""."
"5105","         Now loops may be nested inside each other. For instance, suppose t we wish to"

"5128","is the essence of modularity in programming. Modularity exists, of course, in hi-fi"
"5129","systems, furniture, living cells, human society-wherever there is hierarchical"
"5130","organization."
"5131","        More often than not, one wants a procedure which will act variably, according to"
"5132","context. Such a procedure can either be given a way of peering out at what is stored in"
"5133","memory and selecting its actions accordingly, or it can be explicitly fed a list of"
"5134","parameters which guide its choice of what actions to take. Sometimes both of these"
"5135","methods are used. In RTN terminology, choosing the sequence of actions to carry out"
"5136","amounts to choosing which pathway to follow. An RTN which has been souped up with"
"5137","parameters and conditions that control the choice of pathways inside it is called an"
"5138","Augmented Transition Network (ATN). A place where you might prefer ATN's to RTN's"
"5139","is in producing sensible-as distinguished from nonsensical-English sentences out of raw"
"5140","words, according to a grammar represented in a set of ATN's. The parameters and"

"5148","you've made the move, and now evaluate the board from the point of view of your"

"5153",""
"5154","notice that we have now defined ""best move"" recursively, simply maxim that what is best"
"5155","for one side is worst for the other. The procedure which looks for the best move operates"
"5156","by trying a move and then calling on itself in the role of opponent! As such, it tries"
"5157","another n calls on itself in the role of its opponent's opponent-that is, its"
"5158","         This recursion can go several levels deep-but it's got to bottom out somewhere!"
"5159","How do you evaluate a board position without looking There are a number of useful"
"5160","criteria for this purpose, such as si number of pieces on each side, the number and type of"

"5162","bottom, the recursive move-generator can pop back upwards an( evaluation at the top"

"5164","how many moves to look ahead. TI most call on the procedure will use some externally"

"5185","Now what is the connection between the recursive processes of this Chapter, and the"
"5186","recursive sets of the preceding Chapter? The answer involves the notion of a recursively"
"5187","enumerable set. For a set to be r.e. means that it can be generated from a set of starting"
"5188","points (axioms), by the repeated application of rules of inference. Thus, the set grows and"
"5189","grows, each new element being compounded somehow out of previous elements, in a sort"
"5190","of ""mathematical snowball"". But this is the essence of recursion-something being defined"
"5191","in terms of simpler versions of itself, instead of explicitly. The Fibonacci numbers and"
"5192","the Lucas numbers are perfect examples of r.e. sets-snowballing from two elements by a"
"5193","recursive rule into infinite sets. It is just a matter of convention to call an r.e. set whose"
"5194","complement is also r.e. ""recursive""."
"5195","        Recursive enumeration is a process in which new things emerge from old things"
"5196","by fixed rules. There seem to be many surprises in such processes-for example the"
"5197","unpredictability of the Q-sequence. It might seem that recursively defined sequences of"
"5198","that type possess some sort of inherently increasing complexity of behavior, so that the"
"5199","further out you go, the less predictable they get. This kind of thought carried a little"
"5200","further suggests that suitably complicated recursive systems might be strong enough to"

"5287","Tortoise: This jukebox is different, Achilles. The one record sits vertically, suspended, and"
"5288","        behind it there is a small but elaborate network of overhead rails, from which hang"
"5289","        various record players. When push a pair of buttons, such as B-1, that selects one of the"
"5290","        record players. This triggers an automatic mechanism that starts the record player"
"5291","        squeakily rolling along the rusty tracks. It gets shunted alongside the record-then it clicks"
"5292","        into playing position."
"5293","Achilles: And then the record begins spinning and music comes out -- right?"
"5294","Tortoise: Not quite. The record stands still-it's the record player which rotates."
"5295","Achilles: I might have known. But how, if you have but one record to play can you get more than"
"5296","        one song out of this crazy contraption?"
"5297","Tortoise: I myself asked the Crab that question. He merely suggested I try it out. So I fished a"
"5298","        quarter from my pocket (you get three plays for a quarter), stuffed it in the slot, and hit"
"5299","        buttons B-1, then C-3 then B-10-all just at random."
"5300","Achilles: So phonograph B-1 came sliding down the rail, I suppose, plugged itself into the"

"5307","Achilles: Now don't tell me that C-3 played another song?"
"5308","Tortoise: It did just that."
"5309","Achilles: Ah, I understand. It played the flip side of the first song, or another band on the same"
"5310","        side."
"5311","Tortoise: No, the record has grooves only on one side, and has only a single band."

"5313","Achilles: I don't understand that at all. You CAN'T pull different songs out of the same record!"

"5315","       song go?"

"5317","Achilles: That's a totally different melody!"
"5318","Tortoise: True."
"5319","Achilles: And isn't John Cage a composer of modern music? I seem to remember reading about"
"5320","       him in one of my books on haiku."
"5321","Tortoise: Exactly. He has composed many celebrated pieces, such as 4'33"", a three-movement"
"5322","       piece consisting of silences of different lengths. It's wonderfully expressive-if you like"
"5323","       that sort of thing."
"5324","Achilles: I can see where if I were in a loud and brash cafe I might gladly pay to hear Cage's"
"5325","       4'33"" on a jukebox. It might afford some relief!"
"5326","Tortoise: Right-who wants to hear the racket of clinking dishes and jangling silverware? By the"
"5327","       way, another place where 4'33"" would come in handy is the Hall of Big Cats, at feeding"

"5329","Achilles: Are you suggesting that Cage belongs in the zoo? Well, I guess that makes some sense."
"5330","       But about the Crab's jukebox ... I am baffled. How could both ""BACH"" and ""CAGE"" be"
"5331","       coded inside a single record at once?"
"5332","Tortoise: You may notice that there is some relation between the two, Achilles, if you inspect"
"5333","       them carefully. Let me point the way. What do you get if you list the successive intervals"
"5334","       in the melody B-A-C-H?"
"5335","Achilles: Let me see. First it goes down one semitone, from B to A (where B is taken the"
"5336","       German way); then it rises three semitones to C; and finally it falls one semitone, to H."
"5337","       That yields the pattern:"
"5338","                                                -1, +3, -1."
"5339","Tortoise: Precisely. What about C-A-G-E, now?"
"5340","Achilles: Well, in this case, it begins by falling three semitones, then ten semitones (nearly an"
"5341","       octave), and finally falls three more semitones. That means the pattern is:"
"5342","                                               -3, +10, -3."
"5343","       It's very much like the other one, isn't it?"
"5344","Tortoise: Indeed it is. They have exactly the same ""skeleton"", in a certain sense. You can make"
"5345","       C-A-G-E out of B-A-C-H by multiplying all the intervals by 31/3, and taking the nearest"
"5346","       whole number."
"5347","Achilles: Well, blow me down and pick me up! So does that mean that only"
"5348",""
"5349","       some sort of skeletal code is present in the grooves, and that the various record players"
"5350","       add their own interpretations to that code?"
"5351","Tortoise: I don't know, for sure. The cagey Crab wouldn't fill me in on the details. But I did get"
"5352","       to hear a third song, when record player B-1 swiveled into place."
"5353","Achilles: How did it go?"
"5354","Tortoise: The melody consisted of enormously wide intervals, and we B-C-A-H."
"5355","       The interval pattern in semitones was:"
"5356","                                -10,    +33,     -10."
"5357","       It can be gotten from the CAGE pattern by yet another multiplication by 3%3, and"
"5358","       rounding to whole numbers."
"5359","Achilles: Is there a name for this kind of interval multiplication?"
"5360","Tortoise: One could call it ""intervallic augmentation"". It is similar to tl canonic device of"
"5361","       temporal augmentation, where all the time values notes in a melody get multiplied by"
"5362","       some constant. There, the effect just to slow the melody down. Here, the effect is to"
"5363","       expand the melodic range in a curious way."
"5364","Achilles: Amazing. So all three melodies you tried were intervallic augmentations of one single"
"5365","       underlying groove-pattern in the record:"
"5366","Tortoise: That's what I concluded."
"5367","Achilles: I find it curious that when you augment BACH you get CAGE and when you augment"
"5368","       CAGE over again, you get BACH back, except jumbled up inside, as if BACH had an"
"5369","       upset stomach after passing through the intermediate stage of CAGE."

"5379","mechanism with a message-as in the preceding Dialogue. In the latter case, meaning"
"5380","could not said to be located in any single place, nor could it be said that a message has"

"5392","isomorphism between groove-patterns and sounds, and the record player is a mechanism"
"5393","which physically realizes that isomorphism. It is natural, then, to think of the record as an"
"5394","information-bearer, and the record-player as an information-revealer. A second example"
"5395","of these notions is given by the pq-system. There, the ""information-bearers"" are the"

"6345","represents the word 'not'-it is a formal sort of negation. The angle brackets '<' and `>' are"
"6346","groupers-their function being very similar to that of parentheses in ordinary algebra. The"
"6347","main difference is that in algebra, you have the freedom to insert parentheses or to leave"
"6348","them out, according to taste and style, whereas in a formal system, such anarchic freedom"
"6349","is not tolerated. The symbol '∨' represents the word `or' ('vel' is a Latin word for `or'). The"
"6350","`or' that is meant is the so-called inclusive `or', which means that the interpretation of"
"6351","<x∨y> is ""either x or y-or both""."
"6352","         The only symbols we have not interpreted are the atoms. An atom has no single"

"6363","Note how I rendered the double negation. It is awkward to repeat a negation in any"

"6365","negation. The second theorem we derived was <<P∧Q>⊃<Q∧P>>. If we let Q be"

"6368","If this mind is Buddha and this flax weighs three pounds,"

"6412","Before we see these rules used inside derivations, let us look at some very short"
"6413","justifications for them. You can probably justify them to yourself better than my"
"6414","examples – which is why I only give a couple."
"6415","        The contrapositive rule expresses explicitly a way of turning around conditional"
"6416","statements which we carry out unconsciously. For instance, the “Zentence”"
"6417","        If you are studying it, then you are far from the Way"
"6418","Means the same thing as"
"6419","        If you are close to the Way, then you are not studying it."
"6420","        De Morgan’s rule can be illustrated by our familiar sentence “The flag is not"
"6421","moving and the wind is not moving”. If P symbolizes “the flag is not moving”, and Q"
"6422","symbolizes “the wind is moving”, then the compound sentence is symbolized by"
"6423","<~P∧~Q>, which, according to Morgan’s law, is interchangeable with ~<P∨Q>. whose"
"6424","interpretation would be “It is not true that either the flag or the wind is moving”. And no"
"6425","one could deny that it is a Zensible conclusion to draw."
"6426","        For the Switrcheroo rule, consider the sentence “Either a cloud is hanging over"
"6427","the mountain, or the moonlight is penetrating the waves of the lake,” which might be"
"6428","spoken, I suppose, by a wistful Zen master remembering a familiar lake which he can"
"6429","visualize mentally but cannot see. Now hang on to your seat, for the Swircheroo rule tells"
"6430","us that this is interchangeable with the thought “If a cloud is not hanging over the"
"6431","mountain, then the moonlight is penetrating the waves of the lake.” This may not be"
"6432","enlightenment, but it is the best the Propositional Calculus has to offer."
"6433","                           Playing around with the system"
"6434","Now, let us apply these rules to a previous theorem, ands see what we get: For instance,"

"6451","Despite the fact that P is not a sentence, the above semisentence still sounds true, because"
"6452","you can very easily imagine sticking any sentence in for P – and the form of the semi-"
"6453","interpreted theorem assures you that however you make your choice, the resulting"
"6454","sentence will be true. And that is the key idea of the Propositional Calculus: it produces"
"6455","theorems which, when semi-interpreted, are seen to be “universally true semisaentences”,"

"6461","    One day Tokusan told his student Ganto, “I have two monks who have been here"

"6620","When carrying out derivations in the Propositional Calculus, one quickly invents various"
"6621","types of shortcut, which are not strictly part of the system For instance, if the string"
"6622","<Q∨~Q> were needed at some point, and <P∨~P> had been derived earlier, many people"
"6623","would proceed as if <Q∨~Q> had been derived, since they know that its derivation is an"

"6628","the system. That this rule keeps you within the space of theorems needs proof, of course-"
"6629","but such a proof is not like a derivation inside the system. It is a proof in the ordinary,"
"6630","intuitive sense -- a chain of reasoning carried out in the I-mode. The theory about the"
"6631","Propositional Calculus is a ""metatheory"", and results in it can be called ""metatheorems"" -"
"6632","Theorems about theorems. (Incidentally, note the peculiar capitalization in the phrase"
"6633","""Theorems about theorems"". It is a consequence of our convention: metatheorems are"
"6634","Theorems (proven results) concerning theorems (derivable strings).)"
"6635","        In the Propositional Calculus, one could discover many metatheorems, or derived"
"6636","rules of inference. For instance, there is a De Morgan's Rule:"
"6637","The Propositional Calculus                                                               201"

"6641","we prove that it is correct, isn't that good enough? Can't we use it just like a rule of"
"6642","inference, from then on?"
"6643","         There is no reason to doubt the correctness of this particular derived rule. But"
"6644","once you start admitting derived rules as part of your procedure in the Propositional"
"6645","Calculus, you have lost the formality of the system, since derived rules are derived"

"6652","On the other hand, there is an alternative way out. Why not formalize the metatheory,"
"6653","too? That way, derived rules (metatheorems) would be theorems of a larger formal"
"6654","system, and it would be legitimate to look for shortcuts and derive them as theorems-that"
"6655","is, theorems of the formalized metatheory-which could then be used to speed up the"
"6656","derivations of theorems of the Propositional Calculus. This is an interesting idea, but as"
"6657","soon as it is suggested, one jumps ahead to think of metametatheories, and so on. It is"
"6658","clear that no matter how many levels you formalize, someone will eventually want to"
"6659","make shortcuts in the top level."
"6660","         It might even be suggested that a theory of reasoning could be identical to its own"
"6661","metatheory, if it were worked out carefully. Then, it might seem, all levels would"
"6662","collapse into one, and thinking about the system would be just one way of working in the"
"6663","system! But it is not that easy. Even if a system can ""think about itself"", it still is not"
"6664","outside itself. You, outside the system, perceive it differently from the way it perceives"
"6665","itself. So there still is a metatheory-a view from outside-even for a theory which can"
"6666","""think about itself"" inside itself. We will find that there are theories which can ""think"
"6667","about themselves"". In fact, we will soon see a system in which this happens completely"
"6668","accidentally, without our even intending it! And we will see what kinds of effects this"
"6669","produces. But for our study of the Propositional Calculus, we will stick with the simplest"

"6671","         Fallacies can result if you fail to distinguish carefully between working in the"

"6901","                   The Crab Canon and Indirect Self-Reference"
"6902","THREE EXAMPLES OF indirect self-reference are found in the Crab Canon. Achilles"
"6903","and the Tortoise both describe artistic creations they know-and, quite accidentally, those"
"6904","creations happen to have the same structure as the Dialogue they're in. (Imagine my"
"6905","surprise, when I, the author, noticed this!) Also, the Crab describes a biological structure"
"6906","and that, too, has the same property. Of course, one could read the Dialogue and"
"6907","understand it and somehow fail to notice that it, too, has the form of a crab canon. This"
"6908","would be understanding it on one level, but not on another. To see the self-reference, one"
"6909","has to look at the form, as well as the content, of the Dialogue."
"6910","        Gödel’s construction depends on describing the form, as well as the content, of"
"6911","strings of the formal system we shall define in this Chapter -- Typographical Number"
"6912","Theory (TNT). The unexpected twist is that, because of the subtle mapping which Gödel"
"6913","discovered, the form of strings can be described in the formal system itself. Let us"
"6914","acquaint ourselves with this strange system with the capacity for wrapping around."
"6915","What We Want to Be Able to Express in TNT"
"6916","We'll begin by citing some typical sentences belonging to number theory; then we will"
"6917","try to find a set of basic notions in terms of which all our sentences can be rephrased."
"6918","Those notions will then be given individual symbols. Incidentally, it should be stated at"
"6919","the outset that the term ""number theory"" will refer only to properties of positive integers"
"6920","and zero (and sets of such integers). These numbers are called the natural numbers."
"6921","Negative numbers play no role in this theory. Thus the word ""number"", when used, will"
"6922","mean exclusively a natural number. And it is important -- vital-for you to keep separate in"
"6923","your mind the formal system (TNT) and the rather ill-defined but comfortable old branch"
"6924","of mathematics that is number theory itself; this I shall call ""N""."
"6925","Some typical sentences of N-number theory-are:"
"6926","(1)     5 is prime."
"6927","(2)     2 is not a square."
"6928","(3)     1729 is a sum of two cubes."
"6929","(4)     No sum of two positive cubes is itself a cube."
"6930","(5)     There are infinitely many prime numbers."
"6931","(6)     6 is even."
"6932","Typographical Number Theory                                                             212"
"6933",""
"6934","Now it may seem that we will need a symbol for each notion such as ""prime” or ""cube"""
"6935","or ""positive"" -- but those notions are really not primitive. Primeness, for instance, has to"
"6936","do with the factors which a number has, which in turn has to do with multiplication."
"6937","Cubeness as well is defined in terms multiplication. Let us rephrase the sentences, then,"
"6938","in terms of what seem to be more elementary notions."
"6939","    (1) There do not exist numbers a and b, both greater than 1. such that 5 equals a"
"6940","         times b."
"6941","    (2) There does not exist a number b, such that b times b equals 2."
"6942","    (3) There exist numbers b and c such that b times b times b, plus c times c times c,"
"6943","         equals 1729."
"6944","    (4') For all numbers b and c, greater than 0, there is no number a such that a times a"
"6945","         times a equals b times b times b plus c times c times c."
"6946","    (5) For each number a, there exists a number b, greater than a, with the property"
"6947","         that there do not exist numbers c and d, both greater than 1, such that b equals c"
"6948","         times d."
"6949","    (6') There exists a number e such that 2 times e equals 6."
"6950","This analysis has gotten us a long ways towards the basic elements of language of"
"6951","number theory. It is clear that a few phrases reappear over a over:"
"6952","              for all numbers b"
"6953","              there exists a number b, such that"
"6954","              greater than"
"6955","              equals"
"6956","              times"
"6957","              plus"
"6958","              0, 1, 2, . ."
"6959","Most of these will be granted individual symbols. An exception is ""greater than"", which"
"6960","can be further reduced. In fact, the sentence ""a is greater than b"" becomes"
"6961","          there exists a number c, not equal to 0, such that a equals b plus c."

"6990","result in a sort of ""austere"" version of TNT-austere in the sense that it is a little harder to"

"6992","         Now what about addition and multiplication? Very simple: we will use the"
"6993","ordinary symbols `+' and `•'. However, we will also introduce a parenthesizing"

"6995","of TNT). To write ""b plus c"" and ""b times c"", for instance, we use the strings"

"6999","well-formed formula. (""Formula""? I use the term instead of ""string"" because it is"
"7000","conventional to do so. A formula is no more and no less than a string of TNT.)"
"7001","Incidentally, addition and multiplication are always to be thought of as binary operations-"
"7002","that is, they unite precisely two numbers, never three or more. Hence, if you wish to"

"7347","by the mathematician and logician Giuseppe Peano, in 1889. In setting out his postulates,"
"7348","Peano was following the path of Euclid in this way: he made no attempt to formalize the"
"7349","principles of reasoning, but tried to give a small set of properties of natural numbers from"
"7350","which everything else could be derived by reasoning. Peano's attempt might thus be"
"7351","considered ""semiformal"". Peano's work had a significant influence, and thus it would be"
"7352","good to show Peano's five postulates. Since the notion of ""natural number"" is the one"
"7353","which Peano was attempting to define, we will not use the familiar term ""natural"
"7354","number"", which is laden with connotation. We will replace it with the undefined term"
"7355","djinn, a word which comes fresh and free of connotations to our mind. Then Peano's five"
"7356","postulates place five restrictions on djinns. There are two other undefined terms: Genie,"
"7357","and meta. I will let you figure out for yourself what usual concept each of them is"
"7358","supposed to represent. The five Peano postulates:"
"7359","    (1) Genie is a djinn."
"7360","    (2) Every djinn has a mesa (which is also a djinn)."
"7361","    (3) Genie is not the mesa of any djinn. (4) Different djinns have different metas."
"7362","    (5) If Genie has X, and each djinn relays X to its mesa, then all djinns get X."
"7363","In light of the lamps of the Little Harmonic Labyrinth, we should name the set of all"
"7364","djinns ""GOD"". This harks back to a celebrated statement by the German mathematician"

"7388","quantifier, and at the same time to change the internal strut of the string which remains, if"
"7389","we wish. Here is such a rule:"
"7390","RULE OF SPECIFICATION: Suppose u is a variable which occurs inside string x. If the"

"7399","Notice that the rule of specification will allow some formulas which co: free variables"
"7400","(i.e., open formulas) to become theorems. For example following strings could also be"
"7401","derived from Axiom 1, by specification:"

"7418","The need for restrictions on these two rules will shortly be demonstrated explicitly."
"7419","Incidentally, this generalization is the same generalization as was mentioned in Chapter"

"7426","RULE OF INTERCHANGE: Suppose u is a variable. Then the strings Vu:- and -3u: are"

"7559","and we have correspondingly higher expectations of TNT than of the pq-system. If the"
"7560","string above is not a theorem, then we will have good reason to consider TNT to be"
"7561","defective. As a matter of fact, there is a name for systems with this kind of defect-they"
"7562","are called ω-incomplete. (The prefix 'ω'-'omega'- comes from the fact that the totality of"
"7563","natural numbers is sometimes denoted by `ω'.) Here is the exact definition:"
"7564","    A system is ω-incomplete if all the strings in a pyramidal family are theorems, but"
"7565","    the universally quantified summarizing string is not a theorem."
"7566","    Incidentally, the negation of the above summarizing string"
"7567","                                        ~Va:(O+a)=a"

"7570","Although it may sound like a mystical term, there is nothing mystical about"
"7571","undecidability within a given system. It is only a sign that the system could be extended."
"7572","For example, within absolute geometry, Euclid's fifth postulate is undecidable. It has to"
"7573","be added as an extra postulate of geometry, to yield Euclidean geometry; or conversely,"
"7574","its negation can be added, to yield non-Euclidean geometry. If you think back to"
"7575","geometry, you will remember why this curious thing happens. It is because the four"
"7576","postulates of absolute geometry simply do not pin down the meanings of the terms"
"7577","""point"" and ""line"", and there is room for different extensions of the notions. The points"
"7578","and lines of Euclidean geometry provide one kind of extension of the notions of ""point"""
"7579","and ""line""; the POINTS and LINES of non-Euclidean geometry, another. However, using"
"7580","the pre-flavored words ""point"" and ""line"" tended, for two millennia, to make people"

"7583","We are now faced with a similar situation, involving TNT. We have adopted a notation"
"7584","which prejudices us in certain ways. For instance, usage of the symbol `+'tends to make"
"7585","us think that every theorem with a plus sign in it ought to say something known and"
"7586","familiar and ""sensible"" about the known and familiar operation we call ""addition""."
"7587","Therefore it would run against the grain to propose adding the following ""sixth axiom"":"

"7594","when you juxtapose this ""sixth axiom"" with the pyramidal family of theorems shown"
"7595","above, you will probably be bothered by a seeming inconsistency between the family and"
"7596","the new axiom. But this kind of inconsistency is riot so damaging as the other kind"

"7654","        A specific example would be to let X{a} stand for the string in question: (O+a)=a."

"8009","Achilles: That's better. Now as I was saying, my master believes only one of the two is"
"8010","   genuine."
"8011","Tortoise: I can't imagine what led him to such a belief. But anyway, I suppose it's all"
"8012","   academic, since there's no way to know if a koan is genuine or phony."
"8013","Achilles: Oh, but there you are mistaken. My master has shown us how to do it."
"8014","Tortoise: Is that so? A decision procedure for genuineness of koans? I should very much"
"8015","   like to hear about THAT."
"8016","Achilles: It is a fairly complex ritual, involving two stages. In the first stage, you must"

"8018","   dimensions."
"8019","Tortoise: That's a curious thing to do. And what is the second stage?"
"8020","Achilles: Oh, that's easy-all you need to do is determine whether the string has Buddha-"
"8021","   nature, or not! If it does, then the koan is genuine-if not, the koan is a fraud."
"8022","Tortoise: Hmm ... It sounds as if all you've done is transfer the need for a decision"
"8023","   procedure to another domain. Now it's a decision procedure for Buddha-nature that"
"8024","   you need. What next? After all, if you can't even tell whether a Do(; has Buddha-"
"8025","   nature or not, how can you expect to do so for every possible folded string?"

"8060","Achilles: You begin with the string entirely straight. Then you go to one end and start"

"8062","Tortoise: So each of those geometric symbols stands for a different way to curl the string"

"8065","   begin at one end of the string, and one end of the messenger. What to do with the first"

"8207","    strings all have Buddha-nature. Tortoise: Of course."

"8209","    complex string figures. In particular, you are allowed to modify your string by doing"
"8210","    certain basic motions of the hands. For instance, you can reach across like this-and"
"8211","    pull like this-and twist like this. With each operation you are changing the overall"
"8212","    configuration of the string draped over your hands."
"8213","Tortoise: Why, it looks just like making cat's-cradles and such string figures!"
"8214","Achilles: That's right. Now as you watch, you'll see that some of these rules make the"

"8216","    follow the String Manipulation Rules, every string you produce will have Buddha-"

"8417","anarchy, darkness, meaninglessness, chaos. It is tantalizing and infuriating. And yet it is"

"8426","though they do not contain enough information in themselves to impart enlightenment,"
"8427","may possibly be sufficient to unlock the mechanisms inside one's mind that lead to"

"8776","          theory of numbers."

"8779","insignificant MIU-system) is one of the most fruitful realizations of all mathematics, and"
"8780","how it changed mathematicians' view of their own discipline."
"8781","         For your ease of reference, here is a recapitulation of the MIU-system:"
"8782","SYMBOLS: M, I, U"
"8783","Axiom: MI"
"8784","RULES:"
"8785","    I. If xl is a theorem, so is xIU."
"8786","    II. If Mx is a theorem, so is Mxx."
"8787","    III. In any theorem, III can be replaced by U."
"8788","    IV. UU can be dropped from any theorem."
"8789","                   Mumon Shows Us How to Solve the MU-puzzle"
"8790","According to the observations above, then, the MU-puzzle is merely a puzzle about"
"8791","natural numbers in typographical disguise. If we could only find a way to transfer it to the"
"8792","domain of number theory, we might be able to solve it. Let us ponder the words of"
"8793","Mumon, who said, ""If any of you has one eye, he will see the failure on the teacher's"
"8794","part."" But why should it matter to have one eye?"
"8795","         If you try counting the number of l's contained in theorems, you will soon notice"
"8796","that it seems never to be 0. In other words, it seems that no matter how much lengthening"
"8797","and shortening is involved, we can never work in such a way that all I's are eliminated."
"8798","Let us call the number of I's in any string the I-count of that string. Note that the I-count"
"8799","of the axiom MI is 1. We can do more than show that the I-count can't be 0-we can show"
"8800","that the I-count can never be any multiple of 3."
"8801","         To begin with, notice that rules I and IV leave the I-count totally undisturbed."
"8802","Therefore we need only think about rules II and III. As far as rule III is concerned, it"
"8803","diminishes the I-count by exactly 3. After an application of this rule, the I-count of the"
"8804","output might conceivably be a multiple of 3-but only if the I-count of the input was also."
"8805","Rule III, in short, never creates a multiple of 3 from scratch. It can only create one when"
"8806","it began with one. The same holds for rule II, which doubles the"
"8807","Mumon and Gödel                                                                           268"

"8809","I-count. The reason is that if 3 divides 2n, then-because 3 does not dig 2-it must divide n"
"8810","(a simple fact from the theory of numbers). Neither rule II nor rule III can create a"
"8811","multiple of 3 from scratch."
"8812","        But this is the key to the MU-puzzle! Here is what we know:"
"8813","    (1) The I-count begins at 1 (not a multiple of 3);"
"8814","    (2) Two of the rules do not affect the I-count at all; (3)"
"8815","    (3) The two remaining rules which do affect the I-count do so in such a way as never"
"8816","    to create a multiple of 3 unless given one initially."
"8817"," The conclusion-and a typically hereditary one it is, too-is that I-count can never become"
"8818","   any multiple of 3. In particular, 0 is a forbid value of the I-count. Hence, MU is not a"
"8819","                                  theorem of the MIU-system."
"8820","        Notice that, even as a puzzle about I-counts, this problem was plagued by the"
"8821","crossfire of lengthening and shortening rules. Zero became the goal; I-counts could"
"8822","increase (rule II), could decrease (rule III). 1 we analyzed the situation, we might have"

"9001","All we have done is replace one relatively short string (MU) by another (the monstrous"

"9003","It isn't likely that the answer will be any more forthcoming even though the question has"

"9005","rules, and the reformulation of the question is likely to be far harder than the original."
"9006","One might even say that looking at MU via MUMON is an intentionally idiotic way of"
"9007","doing things. However, MUMON can be looked at on more than one level."
"9008","          In fact, this is an intriguing point: MUMON has two different passive meanings."
"9009","Firstly, it has the one which was given before:"
"9010","                                       30 is a MIU-number."
"9011","But secondly, we know that this statement is tied (via isomorphism) to the statement"
"9012","                               MU is a theorem of the MIU-system."
"9013","So we can legitimately quote this latter as the second passive meaning of MUMON. It"
"9014","may seem very strange because, after all, MUMON contains nothing but plus signs,"
"9015","parentheses, and so forth-symbols of TNT. How can it possibly express any statement"
"9016","with other than arithmetical content?"
"9017","          The fact is, it can. Just as a single musical line may serve as both harmony and"
"9018","melody in a single piece; just as ""BACH"" may be interpreted as both a name and a"
"9019","melody; just as a single sentence may be an accurate structural description of a picture by"
"9020","Escher, of a section of DNA, of a piece by Bach, and of the dialogue in which the"
"9021","sentence is embedded, so MUMON can be taken in (at least) two entirely different ways."
"9022","This state of affairs comes about because of two facts:"
"9023","     Fact 1. Statements such as ""MU is a theorem"" can be coded into number theory"

"9025","     Fact 2. Statements of number theory can be translated into TNT."

"9352","   which a rock made on plummeting into a lake from the ripples which spread out over"

"9354","Crab: Why, that sounds next to impossible!"

"9368","Achilles: Thus think the nave ... But Mr. T has devoted many year this problem, and"
"9369","   came to the realization that the whole thing hinged on the number of solutions to the"

"9507","Anteater: Fugues have that interesting property, that each of their voices is a piece of"
"9508","   music in itself; and thus a fugue might be thought o collection of several distinct"
"9509","   pieces of music, all based on one theme, and all played simultaneously. And it is up to"

"9602","         The conclusion is that in normal chess play, certain types of situation recur-"

"9782","                 And here is the vital point: someone can write, in machine language, a"

"9848","        machine language."
"9849","                 Also, interpreters were invented. Like compilers, interpreters translate"
"9850","        from high-level languages into machine language, but instead of translating all the"
"9851","        statements first and then executing the machine code, they read one line and'"
"9852","        execute it immediately. This has the advantage that a user need not have written a"
"9853","        complete program to use an interpreter. He may invent his program line by line,"
"9854","        and test it out as he goes along. Thus, an interpreter is to a compiler as a"
"9855","        simultaneous interpreter is to a translator of a written speech. One of the most"
"9856","        important and fascinating of all computer languages is LISP (standing for ""List"
"9857","        Processing""), which was invented by John McCarthy around the time Algol was"
"9858","        invented. Subsequently, LISP has enjoyed great popularity with workers in"
"9859","        Artificial Intelligence."
"9860","                 There is one interesting difference between the way interpreters work and"
"9861","        compilers work. A compiler takes input (a finished Algol program, for instance)"
"9862","        and produces output (a long sequence of machine language instructions). At this"
"9863","        point, the compiler has done its duty. The output is then given to the computer to"
"9864","        run. By contrast, the interpreter is constantly running while the programmer types"
"9865","        in one LISP statement after another, and each one gets executed then' and there."
"9866","        But this doesn't mean that each statement gets first translated, then executed, for"
"9867","        then an interpreter would be nothing but a line-by-line compiler. Instead, in an"
"9868","        interpreter, the operations of reading a new line, ""understanding"" it, and executing"
"9869","        it are intertwined: they occur simultaneously."
"9870","                 Here is the idea, expanded a little more. Each time a new line of LISP is"
"9871","        typed in, the interpreter tries to process it. This means that the interpreter jolts into"
"9872","        action, and certain (machine language) instructions inside it get executed."
"9873","        Precisely which ones get executed depends on the LISP statement itself, of"
"9874","        course. There are many JUMP instructions inside the interpreter, so that the new"
"9875","        line of LISP may cause control to move around in a complex way-forwards,"
"9876","        backwards, then forwards again, etc.. Thus, each LISP statement gets converted"
"9877","        into a ""pathway"" inside the interpreter, and the act of following that pathway"
"9878","        achieves the desired effect."
"9879","                 Sometimes it is helpful to think of the LISP statements as mere pieces of"
"9880","        data which are fed sequentially to a constantly running machine language"
"9881","        program (the LISP interpreter). When you think of things this way, you get a"

"10760","    random way, there are nevertheless overall trends, involving large numbers of ants,"
"10761","    which can emerge from that chaos."
"10762","Achilles: Oh, I know what you mean. In fact, ant trails are a perfect example of such a"
"10763","    phenomenon. There, you have really quite unpredictable motion on the part of any"
"10764","    single ant-and yet, the trail itself seems to remain well-defined and stable. Certainly"
"10765","    that must mean that the individual ants are not just running about totally at random."
"10766","Anteater: Exactly, Achilles. There is some degree of communication among the ants, just"

"10798","Anteater: Exactly. The other thing that can happen is that a critical mass of ants is"
"10799","    present, and the thing will snowball, bringing more and more ants into the picture. In"
"10800","    the latter case, a whole ""team"" is brought into being which works on a single project."

"10804","Achilles: I can grasp the general idea of order emerging from chaos, as you sketch it, but"

"10811","    behavior of an ant colony and the explanation of the behavior of gas inside a"
"10812","    container. One can explain the behavior of the gas simply by calculating the"

"10892","Anteater: Now there's a vital point. It requires some elaboration. You see, what it comes"
"10893","    down to is how you choose to describe the caste distribution. If you continue to think"
"10894","    in terms of the lower levels-individual ants-then you miss the forest for the trees."
"10895","    That's just too microscopic a level, and when you think microscopically, you're"
"10896","    bound to miss some large-scale features. You've got to find the proper high-level"
"10897","    framework in which to describe the caste distribution-only then will it make sense"
"10898","    how the caste distribution can encode many pieces of knowledge."
"10899","Achilles: Well, how DO you find the proper-sized units in which to describe the present"
"10900","    state of the colony, then?"
"10901","Anteater: All right. Let's begin at the bottom. When ants need to get something done,"
"10902","    they form little ""teams"", which stick together to perform a chore. As I mentioned"
"10903","    earlier, small groups of ants are constantly forming and unforming. Those which"
"10904","    actually exist for a while are the teams, and the reason they don't fall apart is that"
"10905","    there really is something for them to do."
"10906","Achilles: Earlier you said that a group will stick together if its size exceeds a certain"
"10907","    threshold. Now you're saying that a group will stick together if there is something for"
"10908","    it to do."
"10909","Anteater: They are equivalent statements. For instance, in food-gathering,"
"10910","Ant Fugue                                                                                325"
"10911",""
"10912","    if there is an inconsequential amount of food somewhere which gets discovered by"
"10913","    some wandering Ant who then attempts to communicate its enthusiasm to other ants,"
"10914","    the number of ants who respond will be proportional to the size of the food sample-"
"10915","    and an inconsequential amount will not attract enough ants to surpass the threshold."
"10916","    Which is exactly what I meant by saying there is nothing to do-too little food ought"
"10917","    to be ignored."
"10918","Achilles: I see. I assume that these ""teams"" are one of the levels of structure falling"
"10919","    somewhere in between the single-ant level and the colony level."
"10920","Anteater: Precisely. There exists a special kind of team, which I call a ""signal""-and all the"
"10921","    higher levels of structure are based on signals. In fact, all the higher entities are"
"10922","    collections of signals acting in concert. There are teams on higher levels whose"
"10923","    members are not ants, but teams on lower levels. Eventually you reach the lowest-"
"10924","    level teams which is to say, signals-and below them, ants."
"10925","Achilles: Why do signals deserve their suggestive name?"
"10926","Anteater: It comes from their function. The effect of signals is to transport ants of various"
"10927","    specializations to appropriate parts of the colony. So the typical story of a signal is"
"10928","    thus: it comes into existence by exceeding the threshold needed for survival, then it"
"10929","    migrates for some distance through the colony, and at some point it more or less"
"10930","    disintegrates into its individual members, leaving them on their own."
"10931","Achilles: It sounds like a wave, carrying sand dollars and seaweed from afar, and leaving"
"10932","    them strewn, high and dry, on the shore."
"10933","4nteater: In a way that's analogous, since the team does indeed deposit something which"
"10934","    it has carried from a distance, but whereas the water in the wave rolls back to the sea,"
"10935","    there is no analogous carrier substance in the case of a signal, since the ants"
"10936","    themselves compose it."
"10937","Tortoise: And I suppose that a signal loses its coherency just at some spot in the colony"
"10938","    where ants of that type were needed in the first place."
"10939","Anteater: Naturally."
"10940","Achilles: Naturally? It's not so obvious to ME that a signal should always go just where it"
"10941","    is needed. And even if it goes in the right direction, how does it figure out where to"
"10942","    decompose? How does it know it has arrived?"
"10943","Anteater: Those are extremely important matters, since they involve explaining the"
"10944","    existence of purposeful behavior-or what seems to be purposeful behavior-on the part"
"10945","    of signals. From the description, one would be inclined to characterize the signals'"
"10946","    behavior as being oriented towards filling a need, and to call it ""purposeful"". But you"
"10947","    can look at it otherwise."
"10948","Achilles: Oh, wait. Either the behavior is purposeful, or it is NOT. I don't see how you"
"10949","    can have it both ways."
"10950","Anteater: Let me explain my way of seeing things, and then see if you agree. Once a"
"10951","    signal is formed, there is no awareness on its part that it"
"10952","Ant Fugue                                                                                 326"

"10954","    should head off in any particular direction. But here, the delicate caste distribution"
"10955","    plays a crucial role. It is what determines the motion of signals through the colony,"
"10956","    and also how long a signal will remain stable, and where it will ""dissolve""."
"10957","Achilles: So everything depends on the caste distribution, eh?"
"10958","Anteater: Right. Let's say a signal is moving along. As it goes, the ants which compose it"
"10959","    interact, either by direct contact or by exchange of scents, with ants of the local"
"10960","    neighborhoods which it passes through. The contacts and scents provide information"
"10961","    about local matters of urgency, such as nest-building, or nursing, or whatever. The"
"10962","    signal will remain glued together as long as the local needs are different from what it"
"10963","    can supply; but if it CAN contribute, it disintegrates, spilling a fresh team of usable"
"10964","    ants onto the scene. Do you see now how the caste distribution acts as an overall"
"10965","    guide of the teams inside the colony?"
"10966","Achilles: I do see that."
"10967","Anteater: And do you see how this way of looking at things requires attributing no sense"
"10968","    of purpose to the signal?"
"10969","Achilles: I think so. Actually, I'm beginning to see things from two different vantage"
"10970","    points. From an ant's-eye point of view, a signal has NO purpose. The typical ant in a"
"10971","    signal is just meandering around the colony, in search of nothing in particular, until it"
"10972","    finds that it feels like stopping. Its teammates usually agree, and at that moment the"
"10973","    team unloads itself by crumbling apart, leaving just its members but none of its"
"10974","    coherency. No planning is required, no looking ahead; nor is any search required, to"
"10975","    determine the proper direction. But from the COLONY'S point-of view, the team has"
"10976","    just responded to a message which was written in the language of the caste"
"10977","    distribution. Now from this perspective, it looks very much like purposeful activity."
"10978","Crab: What would happen if the caste distribution were entirely random? Would signals"
"10979","    still band and disband?"
"10980","Anteater: Certainly. But the colony would not last long, due to the meaninglessness of the"
"10981","    caste distribution."
"10982","Crab: -Precisely the point I wanted to make. Colonies survive because their caste"
"10983","    distribution has meaning, and that meaning is a holistic aspect, invisible on lower"
"10984","    levels. You lose explanatory power unless you take that higher level into account."
"10985","Anteater: I see your side; but I believe you see things too narrowly."
"10986","Crab: How so?"
"10987","Anteater: Ant colonies have been subjected to the rigors of evolution for billions of years."
"10988","    A few mechanisms were selected for, and most were selected against. The end result"
"10989","    was a set of mechanisms which make ant colonies work as we have been describing."
"10990","    If you could watch the whole process in a movie-running a billion or so times faster"
"10991","    than life, of course-the emergence of various mechanisms would be seen as natural"
"10992","    responses to external pressures, just as bubbles in boiling water are natural responses"
"10993","    to an external heat source. I don't suppose you"

"10998","Anteater: Now that's MY point. No matter how big a bubble is, it owes its existence to"
"10999","    processes on the molecular level, and you can forget about any ""higher-level laws""."
"11000","    The same goes for ant colonies and their teams. By looking at things from the vast"
"11001","    perspective of evolution, you can drain the whole colony of meaning and purpose."
"11002","    They become superfluous notions."
"11003","Achilles: Why, then, Dr. Anteater, did you tell me that you talked with Aunt Hillary? It"
"11004","    now seems that you would deny that she can talk or think at all."
"11005","Anteater: I am not being inconsistent, Achilles. You see, I have as much difficulty as"
"11006","    anyone else in seeing things on such a grandiose time scale, so I find it much easier"
"11007","    to change points of view. When I do so, forgetting about evolution and seeing things"
"11008","    in the here and now, the vocabulary of teleology comes back: the MEANING of the"
"11009","    caste distribution and the PURPOSEFULNESS of signals. This not only happens"
"11010","    when I think of ant colonies, but also when I think about my own brain and other"
"11011","    brains. However, with some effort I can always remember the other point of view if"
"11012","    necessary, and drain all these systems of meaning, too."
"11013","Crab: Evolution certainly works some miracles. You never know the next trick it will pull"
"11014","    out of its sleeve. For instance, it wouldn't surprise me one bit if it were theoretically"
"11015","    possible for two or more ""signals"" to pass through each other, each one unaware that"
"11016","    the other one is also a signal; each one treating the other as if it were just part of the"

"11057","    distribution, as you said, Dr. Anteater, gets continually updated in a way which"
"11058","    ultimately reflects the outer world."
"11059","Achilles: But what about those intermediate levels of structure? You were saying that the"
"11060","    caste distribution should best be pictured not in terms of ants or signals, but in terms"
"11061","    of teams whose members were other teams, whose members were other teams, and"

"11064","    pieces of information about the world."
"11065","Anteater: Yes, we are coming to all that. I prefer to give teams of a sufficiently high level"
"11066","    the name of ""symbols"". Mind you, this sense of the word has some significant"
"11067","    differences from the usual sense. My ""symbols"" are ACTIVE SUBSYSTEMS of a"
"11068","    complex system, and they are composed of lower-level active subsystems ... They are"
"11069","    therefore quite different from PASSIVE symbols, external to the system, such as"
"11070","    letters of the alphabet or musical notes, which sit there immobile, waiting for an"
"11071","    active system to process them."
"11072","Achilles: Oh, this is rather complicated, isn't it? I just had no idea that ant colonies had"
"11073","    such an abstract structure."
"11074","Anteater: Yes, it's quite remarkable. But all these layers of structure are necessary for the"
"11075","    storage of the kinds of knowledge which enable an organism to be ""intelligent"" in"
"11076","    any reasonable sense of the word. Any system which has a mastery of language has"
"11077","    essentially the same underlying sets of levels."
"11078","Achilles: Now just a cotton-picking minute. Are you insinuating that my brain consists"
"11079","    of, at bottom, just a bunch of ants running around?"
"11080","Anteater: Oh, hardly. You took me a little too literally. The lowest level may be utterly"
"11081","    different. Indeed, the brains of anteaters, for instance, are not composed of ants. But"
"11082","    when you go up a level or two in a brain, you reach a level whose elements have"
"11083","    exact counterparts in other systems of equal intellectual strength-such as ant colonies."
"11084","Tortoise: That is why it would be reasonable to think of mapping your brain, Achilles,"
"11085","    onto an ant colony, but not onto the brain of a mere ant."
"11086","Achilles: I appreciate the compliment. But how would such a mapping be carried out?"
"11087","    For instance, what in my brain corresponds to the low level teams which you call"
"11088","    signals?"
"11089","Anteater: Oh, I but dabble in brains, and therefore couldn't set up the map in its glorious"
"11090","    detail. But-and correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. Crab-I would surmise that the brain"
"11091","    counterpart to an ant colony's signal is the firing of a neuron; or perhaps it is a larger-"

"11099","    Anteater, which you raised, and that concerns the level at which one can have faith"

"11104","    Thank you for bringing out that subtle point."
"11105","Achilles: What does a symbol do that a signal couldn't do?"
"11106","Anteater: It is something like the difference between words and letters. Words, which are"
"11107","    meaning-carrying entities, are composed of letters, which in themselves carry no"
"11108","    meaning. This gives a good idea of the difference between symbols and signals. In"
"11109","    fact it is a useful analogy, as long as you keep in mind the fact that words and letters"
"11110","    are PASSIVE, symbols and signals are ACTIVE."
"11111","Achilles: I'll do so, but I'm not sure I understand why it is so vital to stress the difference"
"11112","    between active and passive entities."
"11113","Anteater: The reason is that the meaning which you attribute to any passive symbol, such"
"11114","    as a word on a page, actually derives from the meaning which is carried by"
"11115","    corresponding active symbols in your brain. So that the meaning of passive symbols"
"11116","    can only be properly understood when it is related to the meaning of active symbols."
"11117","Achilles: All right. But what is it that endows a SYMBOL-an active one, to be sure-with"
"11118","    meaning, when you say that a SIGNAL, which is a perfectly good entity in its own"
"11119","    right, has none? Anteater: It all has to do with the way that symbols can cause other"
"11120","    symbols to be triggered. When one symbol becomes active, it does not do so in"
"11121","    isolation. It is floating about, indeed, in a medium, which is characterized by its caste"
"11122","    distribution."
"11123","Crab: Of course, in a brain there is no such thing as a caste distribution, but the"
"11124","    counterpart is the ""brain state"". There, you describe the states of all the neurons, and"
"11125","    all the interconnections, and the threshold for firing of each neuron."
"11126","Anteater: Very well; let's lump ""caste distribution"" and ""brain state"" under a common"
"11127","    heading, and call them just the ""state"". Now the state can be described on a low level"
"11128","    or on a high level. A low-level description of the state of an ant colony would involve"
"11129","    painfully specifying the location of each ant, its age and caste, and other similar"
"11130","    items. A very detailed description, yielding practically no global insight as to WHY it"
"11131","    is in that state. On the other hand, a description on a high level would involve"

"11150","    Admittedly, were it not for them, the colony Wouldn't exist: but something"
"11151","    equivalent-a brain-can exist, ant-free. So, at least from a high-level point of view, the"

"11155","Crab: What a counterintuitive picture you paint, Dr. Anteater. It seems that, if what you"

"11162","    of mapping letters onto ideas, so that the entire Pickwick Papers makes sense when"
"11163","    you read it letter by letter."
"11164","Achilles: Hmm ... You mean that every time I hit a word such as ""the"", I have to think of"
"11165","    three definite concepts, one after another, with no room for variation?"
"11166","Anteater: Exactly. They are the `t'-concept, the `h'-concept, and the `e'-concept-and every"
"11167","    time, those concepts are as they were the preceding time."
"11168","Achilles: Well, it sounds like that would turn the experience of ""reading"" The Pickwick"
"11169","    Papers into an indescribably boring nightmare. It would be an exercise in"
"11170","    meaninglessness, no matter what concept I associated with each letter."
"11171","Anteater: Exactly. There is no natural mapping from the individual letters into the real"
"11172","    world. The natural mapping occurs on a higher level between words, and parts of the"

"11177","Achilles: Of course not! I'd describe the plot and the characters, and so forth."
"11178","Anteater: So there you are. You would omit all mention of the building blocks, even"
"11179","    though the book exists thanks to them. They are the medium, but not the message."
"11180","Achilles: All right-but what about ant colonies?"
"11181","Anteater: Here, there are active signals instead of passive letters, and active symbols"
"11182","    instead of passive words-hut the idea carries over."
"11183","Achilles: Do you mean I couldn't establish a mapping between signals and things in the"

"11185","Anteater: You would find that you could not do it in such a way that the triggering of new"
"11186","    signals would make am sense. Nor could you succeed on any lower level-for example"
"11187","    the ant level. Only on the symbol level do the triggering patterns make sense."
"11188","    Imagine, for instance, that one day you were watching Aunt Hillary when I arrived to"

"11190","    perceive nothing more than a rearrangement of ants."
"11191","Achilles: I'm sure that's accurate."
"11192","Anteater: And yet, as I watched, reading the higher level instead of the lower level, I"
"11193","    would see several dormant symbols being awakened, those which translate into the"
"11194","    thought, ""Oh, here's that charming Dr. Anteater again-how pleasant!""-or words to"
"11195","    that effect."
"11196","Achilles: That sounds like what happened when the four of us all found different levels to"

"11198","Tortoise: What an astonishing coincidence that there should be such a resemblance"
"11199","    between that strange picture which I chanced upon in the Well-Tempered Clavier,"
"11200","    and the trend of our conversation."
"11201","Achilles: Do you think it's just coincidence?"
"11202","Tortoise: Of course."
"11203","Anteater: Well, I hope you can grasp now how the thoughts in Aunt Hillary emerge from"
"11204","    the manipulation of symbols composed of signals composed of teams composed of"
"11205","    lower-level teams, all the way down to ants."
"11206","Achilles: Why do you call it ""symbol manipulation""? Who does the manipulating, if the"
"11207","    symbols are themselves active? Who is the agent?"
"11208","Anteater: This gets back to the question which you earlier raised about purpose. You're"
"11209","    right that symbols themselves are active, but the activities which they follow are"
"11210","    nevertheless not absolutely free. The activities of all symbols are strictly determined"
"11211","    by the state of the full system in which they reside. Therefore, the full system is"
"11212","    responsible for how its symbols trigger each other, and so it is quite reasonable to"
"11213","    speak of the full system as the ""agent"". As the symbols operate, the state of the"
"11214","    system gets slowly transformed, or updated. But there are many features which"
"11215","    remain over time. It is this partially constant, partially varying system which is the"
"11216","    agent. One can give a name to the"
"11217","Ant Fugue                                                                               333"

"11221","Achilles: That's quite a strange characterization of the notion of who I am. I'm not sure I"
"11222","    can fully understand it, but I will give it some thought."
"11223","Tortoise: It would be quite interesting to follow the symbols in your brain as you do that"
"11224","    thinking about the symbols in your brain."
"11225","Achilles: That's too complicated for me. I have trouble enough just trying to picture how"
"11226","    it is possible to look at an ant colony and read it on the symbol level. I can certainly"
"11227","    imagine perceiving it at the ant level; and with a little trouble, I can imagine what it"
"11228","    must be like to perceive it at the signal level; but what in the world can it be like to"
"11229","    perceive an ant colony at the symbol level?"
"11230","Anteater: One only learns through long practice. But when one is at my stage, one reads"
"11231","    the top level of an ant colony as easily as you yourself read the ""MU"" in the MU-"
"11232","    picture."
"11233","Achilles: Really? That must be an amazing experience."
"11234","Anteater: In a way-but it is also one which is quite familiar to you, Achilles."
"11235","Achilles: Familiar to me? What do you mean? I have never looked at an ant colony on"
"11236","    anything but the ant level."
"11237","Anteater: Maybe not; but ant colonies are no different from brains in many respects."
"11238","Achilles: I have never seen nor read any brain either, however."
"11239","Anteater: What about your OWN brain? Aren't you aware of your own thoughts? Isn't"
"11240","    that the essence of consciousness? What else are you doing but reading your own"
"11241","    brain directly at the symbol level?"
"11242","Achilles: I never thought of it that way. You mean that I bypass all the lower levels, and"
"11243","    only see the topmost level?"
"11244","Anteater: That's the way it is, with conscious systems. They perceive themselves on the"
"11245","    symbol level only, and have no awareness of the lower levels, such as the signal"
"11246","    levels."
"11247","Achilles: Does it follow that in a brain, there are active symbols which are constantly"
"11248","    updating themselves so that they reflect the overall state of the brain itself, always on"
"11249","    the symbol level?"
"11250","Anteater: Certainly. In any conscious system there are symbols which represent the brain"
"11251","    state, and they are themselves part of the very brain state which they symbolize. For"
"11252","    consciousness requires a large degree of self-consciousness."
"11253","Achilles: That is a weird notion. It means that although there is frantic activity occurring"
"11254","    in my brain at all times, I am only capable of registering that activity in one way-on"
"11255","    the symbol level; and I am completely insensitive to the lower levels. It is like being"
"11256","    able to read a Dickens novel by direct visual perception, without ever having learned"

"11276","Achilles: Oh, no-that can't be! Let me see. (Looks very carefully.) I know the rest of you"
"11277","    won't believe this, but the message of this picture is staring us all in the face, hidden"
"11278","    in its depths. It is simply one word, repeated over and over again, like a mantra-but"
"11279","    what an important one: ""Mu""! What do you know! It is the same as the top level!"

"11284","Crab: How could one ever decide that?"
"11285","Tortoise: I don't see any way to do so, since we have no idea why that particular picture is"
"11286","    in the Crab's edition of the Well-Tempered Clavier. Anteater: Although we have been"

"11289","Tortoise: It certainly is. And now, in just a moment, comes an organ point."
"11290","Achilles: Isn't an organ point what happens when a piece of music slows down slightly,"
"11291","    settles for a moment or two on a single note or chord, and then resumes at normal"
"11292","    speed after a short silence?"
"11293","Tortoise: No, you're thinking of a ""fermata""-a sort of musical semicolon. Did you notice"
"11294","    there was one of those in the prelude?"
"11295","Achilles: I guess I must have missed it."
"11296","Tortoise: Well, you have another chance coming up to hear a fermata-in fact, there are a"
"11297","    couple of them coming up, towards the end of this fugue."
"11298","Achilles: Oh, good. You'll point them out in advance, won't you? Tortoise: If you like."
"11299","Achilles: But do tell me, what is an organ point?"
"11300","Tortoise: An organ point is the sustaining of a single note by one of the"
"11301","Ant Fugue                                                                                 335"

"11309","Crab: Do tell us about it."
"11310","Anteater: Aunt Hillary had been feeling very lonely, and was very happy to have"
"11311","    someone to talk to that day. So she gratefully told me to help myself to the juiciest"
"11312","    ants I could find. (She's always been most generous with her ants.)"
"11313","Achilles: Gee!"
"11314","Anteater: It just happened that I had been watching the symbols which were carrying out"
"11315","    her thoughts, because in them were some particularly juicy-looking ants."
"11316","Achilles: Gee!"
"11317","Anteater: So I helped myself to a few of the fattest ants which had been parts of the"
"11318","    higher-level symbols which I had been reading. Specifically, the symbols which they"
"11319","    were part of were the ones which had expressed the thought, ""Help yourself to any of"
"11320","    the ants which look appetizing."""
"11321","Achilles: Gee!"
"11322","Anteater: Unfortunately for them, but fortunately for me, the little bugs didn't have the"
"11323","    slightest inkling of what they were collectively telling me, on the symbol level."
"11324","Achilles: Gee! That is an amazing wraparound. They were completely unconscious of"
"11325","    what they were participating in. Their acts could be seen as part of a pattern on a"
"11326","    higher level, but of course they were completely unaware of that. Ah, what a pity-a"
"11327","    supreme irony, in fact-that they missed it."
"11328","Crab: You are right, Mr. T-that was a lovely organ point."
"11329","Anteater: I had never heard one before, but that one was so conspicuous that no one could"
"11330","    miss it. Very effective."
"11331","Achilles: What? Has the organ point already occurred? How can I not have noticed it, if it"
"11332","    was so blatant?"
"11333","Tortoise: Perhaps you were so wrapped up in what you were saying that you were"
"11334","    completely unaware of it. Ah, what a pity-a supreme irony, in fact-that you missed it."
"11335","Crab: Tell me, does Aunt Hillary live in an anthill?"
"11336","Anteater: Well, she owns a rather large piece of property. It used to belong to someone"
"11337","    else, but that is rather a sad story. In any case, her estate is quite expansive. She lives"
"11338","    rather sumptuously, compared to many other colonies."
"11339","!chilies: How does that jibe with the communistic nature of ant colonies which you"
"11340","    earlier described to us? It sounds quite inconsistent, to me, to preach communism and"
"11341","    to live in a fancy estate."
"11342","Ant Fugue                                                                                  336"

"11344","Anteater: The communism is on the ant level. In an ant colony all ants work for the"
"11345","    common good, even to their own individual detriment at times. Now this is simply a"
"11346","    built-in aspect of Aunt Hillary's structure, but for all I know, she may not even be"
"11347","    aware of this internal communism. Most human beings are not aware of anything"
"11348","    about their neurons; in fact they probably are quite content not to know anything"
"11349","    about their brains, being somewhat squeamish creatures. Aunt Hillary is also"
"11350","    somewhat squeamish; she gets rather antsy whenever she starts to think about ants at"
"11351","    all. So she avoids thinking about them whenever possible. I truly doubt that she"
"11352","    knows anything about the communistic society which is built into her very structure."

"11384","Tortoise: There, there, Achilles-don't feel bad. I'm sure you won't miss Fugue's Last"
"11385","    Fermata (which is coming up quite soon). But, to return to our previous topic, Dr."
"11386","    Anteater, what is the very sad story which you alluded to, concerning the former"
"11387","    owner of Aunt Hillary's property"
"11388","Anteater: The former owner was an extraordinary individual, one of the most creative ant"
"11389","    colonies who ever lived. His name was Johant Sebastiant Fermant, and he was a"
"11390","    mathematiciant by vocation, but a musiciant by avocation."
"11391","Achilles: How very versantile of him!"
"11392","Anteater: At the height of his creative powers, he met with a most untimely demise. One"
"11393","    day, a very hot summer day, he was out soaking up the warmth, when a freak"
"11394","    thundershower-the kind that hits only once every hundred years or so-appeared from"
"11395","    out of the blue, and thoroughly drenched J. S F. Since the storm came utterly without"
"11396","    warning, the ants got completely disoriented and confused. The intricate organization"
"11397","    which had been so finely built up over decades, all went down the drain in a matter of"
"11398","    minutes. It was tragic."
"11399","Achilles: Do you mean that all the ants drowned, which obviously would spell the end of"
"11400","    poor J. S. F."
"11401","Anteater: Actually, no. The ants managed to survive, every last one of them, by crawling"
"11402","    onto various sticks and logs which floated above the raging torrents. But when the"
"11403","    waters receded and left the ants back on their home grounds, there was no"
"11404","    organization left. The caste distribution was utterly destroyed, and the ants"
"11405","    themselves had no ability to reconstruct what had once before been such a finely"
"11406","    tuned organization. They were as helpless as the pieces of Humpty Dumpty in putting"
"11407","    themselves back together again. I myself tried, like all the king's horses and all the"
"11408","    king's men, to put poor Fermant together again. I faithfully put out sugar and cheese,"
"11409","    hoping against hope that somehow Fermant would reappear ... (Pulls out a"
"11410","    handkerchief and wipes his eyes.)"

"11415","    However, something very strange then began to take place: over the next few"
"11416","    months, the ants which had been components of J. S. F. slowly regrouped, and built"

"11418","Crab: Remarkable! Aunt Hillary is composed of the very same ants as Fermant was"
"11419","Anteater: Well, originally she was, yes. By now, some of the older ants have died, and"
"11420","    been replaced. But there are still many holdovers from the J. S. F.-days."
"11421","Crab: And can't you recognize some of J. S. F.'s old traits coming to the fore, from time"
"11422","    to time, in Aunt Hillary%"
"11423","Anteater: Not a one. They have nothing in common. And there is no reason they should,"
"11424","    as I see it. There are, after all, often several distinct ways to rearrange a group of"
"11425","    parts to form a ""sum"". And Aunt Hillary was just a new ""sum"" of the old parts. Not"
"11426","    MORE than the sum, mind you just that particular KIND of sum."
"11427","Tortoise: Speaking of sums, I am reminded of number theory, where occasionally one"
"11428","    will be able to take apart a theorem into its component symbols, rearrange them in a"
"11429","    new order, and come up with a new theorem."
"11430","Anteater: I've never heard of such a phenomenon, although I confess to being a total"
"11431","    ignoramus in the field."
"11432","Achilles: Nor have I heard of it-and I am rather well versed in the field, If I don't say so"
"11433","    myself. I suspect Mr. T is just setting up one of his elaborate spoofs. I know him"

"11435","    again, for number theory is one of the domains in which he excelled. In fact, he made"
"11436","    some rather rema, ..able contributions to number theory. Aunt Hillary, on the other"
"11437","    hand, is remarkably dull-witted in anything that has even the remotest connection"
"11438","    with mathematics. Also, she has only a rather banal taste in music, whereas"
"11439","    Sebastiant was extremely gifted in music."
"11440","Achilles: I am very fond of number theory. Could you possibly relate to us something of"
"11441","    the nature of Sebastiant's contributions,"

"11698","Steven Rose describes Lashley's trials and tribulations this way:"
"11699","    Lashley was attempting to identify the locus of memory within the cortex, and, to do so,"
"11700","    first trained rats to run mazes, and then removed various cortical regions. He allowed the"
"11701","    animals to recover and tested the retention of the maze-running skills. To his surprise it"
"11702","    was not possible to find a particular region corresponding to the ability to remember the"
"11703","    way through a maze. instead all the rats which had had cortex regions removed suffered"
"11704","    some kind f impairment, and the extent of the impairment was roughly proportional to the"
"11705","    amount of cortex taken off. Removing cortex damaged the motor and sensory capacities"
"11706","    of the animals, and they would limp, hop, roll, or stagger, but somehow they always"
"11707","    managed to traverse the maze. So far as memory 'as concerned, the cortex appeared to be"
"11708","    equipotential, that is, with all regions of equal possible utility. Indeed, Lashley concluded"
"11709","    rather gloomily in is last paper ""In Search of the Engram"", which appeared in 1950, that"
"11710","    the only conclusion was that memory was not possible at all.'"
"11711","  Curiously, evidence for the opposite point of view was being developed :in Canada at"
"11712","roughly the same time that Lashley was doing his last work, in late 1940's. The"
"11713","neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield was examining the reactions of patients whose brains had"
"11714","been operated on, by inserting electrodes into various parts of their exposed brains, and"
"11715","then using small electrical pulses to stimulate the neuron or neurons to which the"

"11748","  It turns out that retinal neurons are primarily contrast sensors. More specifically, the"
"11749","way they act is this. Each retinal neuron is normally firing at a ""cruising speed"". When its"

"11751","stop firing. However, it will do so only provided that the surrounding part of the retina is"
"11752","less illuminated. So this means that there are two types of neuron: .""on-center"", and ""off-"

"12025","not usually analyze further. These are of word size, roughly-sometimes a little longer,"

"12405","As the story progresses, you fill in more aspects of this road: there is a high bank against"
"12406","which a car could smash. Now does this mean that you are activating the symbol for"

"12408","Undoubtedly both. That is, the network of neurons which represents ""road"" has many"

"12554","constructing your image? A most unlikely theory. Or did it happen instead as a"
"12555","consequence of some introspectively inaccessible interactions of the symbols which were"
"12556","activated in your brain? Obviously the latter seems far more likely. This knowledge that"
"12557","cars are smaller than mountains is not a piece of rote memorization, but a piece of"
"12558","knowledge which can be created by deduction. Therefore, most likely it is not stored in"
"12559","any single symbol in your brain, but rather it can be produced as a result of the activation,"
"12560","followed by the mutual interaction, of many symbols-for example, those for ""compare"","

"12562","not explicitly, but implicitly, in a spread-about manner, rather than as a local ""packet of"
"12563","information"". Such simple facts as relative sizes of objects have to be assembled, rather"

"12674","isomorphism on the neural level (which surely does not exist), or on the macroscopic"
"12675","suborgan level (which surely does exist but does not tell us very much), we ask about the"
"12676","possibility of an isomorphism between brains on the symbol level: a correspondence"
"12677","which not only maps symbols in one brain onto symbols in another brain, but also maps"
"12678","triggering patterns onto triggering patterns. This means that corresponding symbols in the"
"12679","two brains are linked in corresponding ways. This would be a true functional"
"12680","isomorphism-the same type of isomorphism as we spoke of when trying to characterize"
"12681","what it is that is invariant about all butterflies,"
"12682","        It is clear from the outset that such an isomorphism does not exist between any"
"12683","pair of human beings. If it did, they would be completely indistinguishable in their"
"12684","thoughts; but in order for that to be true, they would have to have completely"
"12685","indistinguishable memories, which would mean they would have to have led one and the"
"12686","same life. Even identical twins do not approach, in the remotest degree, this ideal."
"12687","        How about a single individual% When you look back over things which you"
"12688","yourself wrote a few years ago, you think ""How awful!"" and smile with amusement at the"
"12689","person you once were. What is worse is when you do the same thing with something you"
"12690","wrote or said five minutes ago. When this happens, it shows that you do not fully"
"12691","understand the person you were moments ago. The isomorphism from your brain now to"
"12692","your brain then is imperfect. What, then, of the isomorphisms to other people, other"
"12693","species ..."
"12694","        The opposite side of the coin is shown by the power of the communication that"
"12695","arises between the unlikeliest partners. Think of the barriers spanned when you read lines"

"12698","hope to have a sense of the connotations behind the facade of his words, translated into"

"12700","        Thus, on the one hand, we can drop all hopes of finding exactly isomorphic"

"12711","                        Comparing Different Semantic Networks"
"12712","But what is a partial isomorphism? This is a most difficult question to answer. It is made"
"12713","even more difficult by the fact that no one has found an adequate way to represent the"
"12714","network of symbols and their triggering patterns. Sometimes a picture of a small part of"
"12715","such a network of symbols is drawn, where each symbol is represented as a node into"
"12716","which, and out of which, lead some arcs. The lines represent triggering relationships-in"
"12717","some sense. Such figures attempt to capture something of the intuitively sensible notion"
"12718","of ""conceptual nearness"". However, there are many different kinds of nearness, and"
"12719","different ones are relevant in different contexts. A tiny portion of my own ""semantic"
"12720","network"" is shown in Figure 70. The problem is that representing a complex"
"12721","interdependency of many symbols cannot be carried out very easily with just a few lines"
"12722","joining vertices."
"12723","        Another problem with such a diagram is that it is not accurate to think of a symbol"
"12724","as simply ""on"" or ""off"". While this is true of neurons, it does not carry upwards, to"
"12725","collections of them. In this respect, symbols are quite a bit more complicated than"
"12726","neurons-as you might expect, since they are made up of many neurons. The messages that"
"12727","are exchanged between symbols are more complex than the mere fact, ""I am now"
"12728","activated"". That is more like the neuron-level messages. Each symbol can be activated in"
"12729","many different ways, and the type of activation will be influential in determining which"
"12730","other symbols it tries to activate. How these intertwining triggering relationships can be"
"12731","represented in a pictorial manner-indeed, whether they can be at all-is not clear."
"12732","        But for the moment, suppose that issue had been solved. Suppose we now agree"
"12733","that there are certain drawings of nodes, connected by links (let us say they come in"
"12734","various colors, so that various types of conceptual nearness can be distinguished from"
"12735","each other), which capture precisely the way in which symbols trigger other symbols."
"12736","Then under what conditions would we feel that two such drawings were isomorphic, or"
"12737","nearly isomorphic? Since we are dealing with a visual representation of the network of"
"12738","symbols, let us consider an analogous visual problem. How would you try to determine"
"12739","whether two spiderwebs had been spun by spiders belonging to the same species? Would"
"12740","you try to identify individual vertices which correspond exactly, thereby setting up an"
"12741","exact map of one web onto the other, vertex by vertex, fiber by fiber, perhaps even angle"
"12742","by angle? This would be a futile effort. Two webs are never exactly the same: yet there is"
"12743","still some sort of ""style"", ""form"", what-have-you, that infallibly brands a given species'"
"12744","web."

"12749","nearsighted observer-for example an observer who can only see one vertex at a time; and"
"12750","global properties require only a sweeping vision, without attention to detail. Thus, the"
"12751","overall shape of a spiderweb is a global property, whereas the average number of lines"
"12752","meeting at a vertex is a local property. Suppose we agree that the most reasonable"
"12753","criterion for calling two spiderwebs ""isomorphic"" is that they should have been spun by"
"12754","spiders of the same species. Then it is interesting to ask which kind of observation-local"
"12755","or global-tends to be a more reliable guide in determining whether two spiderwebs are"

"12758","                             Translations of ""Jabberwocky"""
"12759","Imagine native speakers of English, French, and German, all of whom have excellent"

"12762","level? Or is it meaningful to ask such a question? The question becomes concrete when"
"12763","you look at the preceding translations of Lewis Carroll's famous ""Jabberwocky""."
"12764","        I chose this example because it demonstrates, perhaps better than an example in"
"12765","ordinary prose, the problem of trying to find ""the same node"" in two different networks"
"12766","which are, on some level of analysis, extremely nonisomorphic. In ordinary language, the"
"12767","task of translation is more straightforward, since to each word or phrase in the original"
"12768","language, there can usually be found a corresponding word or phrase in the new"
"12769","language. By contrast, in a poem of this type, many ""words"" do not carry ordinary"
"12770","meaning, but act purely as exciters of nearby symbols. However, what is nearby in one"
"12771","language may be remote in another."
"12772","        Thus, in the brain of a native speaker of English, ""slithy"" probably activates such"

"12895","        Now that we have carried our geographical analogy quite far, we return to the"
"12896","question of isomorphisms between brains. You might well wonder why this whole"
"12897","question of brain isomorphisms has been stressed so much. What does it matter if two"
"12898","brains are isomorphic, or quasi-isomorphic, or not isomorphic at all? The answer is that"
"12899","we have an intuitive sense that, although other people differ from us in important ways,"
"12900","they are still ""the same"" as we are in some deep and important ways. It would be"
"12901","instructive to be able to pinpoint what this invariant core of human intelligence is, and"

"12903","making each one of us a unique embodiment of this abstract and mysterious quality"
"12904","called ""intelligence""."
"12905","        In our geographic analogy, cities and towns were the analogues of symbols, while"
"12906","roads and highways were analogous to potential triggering paths. The fact that all ASU's"

"12913","ing paths in the same way. These core symbols are like the large cities, to which everyone"
"12914","can make reference without ambiguity. (Incidentally, the fact that cities are localized"
"12915","entities should in no way be taken as indicative that symbols in a brain are small, almost"
"12916","point-like entities. They are merely symbolized in that manner in a network.)"
"12917","        The fact is that a large proportion of every human's network of symbols is"
"12918","universal. We simply take what is common to all of us so much for granted that it is hard"
"12919","to see how much we have in common with other people. It takes the conscious effort of"
"12920","imagining how much-or how little-we have in common with other types of entities, such"
"12921","as stones, cars, restaurants, ants, and so forth, to make evident the large amount of"

"12923","immediately is not the standard overlap, because that is taken for granted as soon as we"
"12924","recognize the humanity of the other person; rather, we look beyond the standard overlap"
"12925","and generally find some major differences, as well as some unexpected, additional"
"12926","overlap."
"12927","        Occasionally, you find that another person is missing some of what you thought"
"12928","was the standard, minimal core-as if Chicago were missing from their ASU, which is"
"12929","almost unimaginable. For instance, someone might not know what an elephant is, or who"
"12930","is President, or that the earth is round. In such cases, their symbolic network is likely to"
"12931","be so fundamentally different from your own that significant communication will be"
"12932","difficult. On the other hand, perhaps this same person will share some specialized kind of"
"12933","knowledge with you-such as expertise in the game of dominoes-so that you can"
"12934","communicate well in a limited domain. This would be like meeting someone who comes"
"12935","from the very same rural area of North Dakota as you do, so that your two ASU's"
"12936","coincide in great detail over a very small region, which allows you to describe how to get"
"12937","from one place to another very fluently."
"12938","                How Much Do Language and Culture Channel Thought?"
"12939","If we now go back to comparing our own symbol network with those of a Frenchman and"
"12940","a German, we can say that we expect them to have the standard core of class symbols,"
"12941","despite the fact of different native languages. We do not expect to share highly"
"12942","specialized networks with them, but we do not expect such sharing with a randomly"
"12943","chosen person who shares our native language, either. The triggering patterns of people"
"12944","with other languages will be somewhat different from our own, but still the major class"

"12951","from"
"12952","Minds and Thoughts                                                                      382"

"12954","dictionaries, novels, or classes-words which at some time may have been prevalent or"
"12955","preferable, but which are now far down in frequency-for example, ""fetch"" instead of"
"12956","""get"", ""quite"" instead of ""very"", etc. Though the meaning usually comes through, there is"
"12957","an alien quality transmitted by the unusual choice of words."
"12958","         But suppose that a foreigner learns to use all words at roughly the normal"
"12959","frequencies. Will that make his speech truly fluent? Probably not. Higher than the word"
"12960","level, there is an association level, which is attached to the culture as a whole-its history,"
"12961","geography, religion, children's stories, literature, technological level, and so on. For"
"12962","instance, to be able to speak modern Hebrew absolutely fluently, you need to know the"
"12963","Bible quite well in Hebrew, because the language draws on a stock of biblical phrases"
"12964","and their connotations. Such an association level permeates each language very deeply."
"12965","Yet there is room for all sorts of variety inside fluency-otherwise the only truly fluent"
"12966","speakers would be people whose thoughts were the most stereotyped possible!"
"12967","         Although we should recognize the depth to which culture affects thought, we"
"12968","should not overstress the role of language in molding thoughts. For instance, what we"
"12969","might call two ""chairs"" might be perceived by a speaker of French as objects belonging to"
"12970","two distinct types: ""chaise"" and ""fauteuil"" (""chair"" and ""armchair""). People whose native"
"12971","language is French are more aware of that difference than we are-but then people who"
"12972","grow up in a rural area are more aware of, say, the difference between a pickup and a"
"12973","truck, than a city dweller is. A city dweller may call them both ""trucks"". It is not the"
"12974","difference in native language, but the difference in culture (or subculture), that gives rise"
"12975","to this perceptual difference."
"12976","         The relationships between the symbols of people with different native languages"
"12977","have every reason to be quite similar, as far as the core is concerned, because everyone"
"12978","lives in the same world. When you come down to more detailed aspects of the triggering"
"12979","patterns, you will find that there is less in common. It would he like comparing rural"
"12980","areas in Wisconsin in ASU's which had been made up by people who had never lived in"
"12981","Wisconsin. This will be quite irrelevant, however, as long as there is sufficient agreement"
"12982","on the major cities and major routes, so that there are common points of reference all"

"12988","perfect analogy, but it is quite strong. One problem with it is that when a thought recurs"
"12989","in someone's mind sufficiently often, it can get chunked into a single concept. This would"
"12990","correspond to quite a strange event in an ASU: a commonly taken trip would become, in"

"12998","         Now if it is granted that the notion of taking a trip is a fair counterpart to the"
"12999","notion of having a thought. then the following difficult issue comes up: virtually any"

"13005","indiscriminate system, which can absorb or produce any thought whatsoever. But we all"
"13006","know that that is not so. In fact, there are certain kinds of thoughts which we call"
"13007","knowledge, or beliefs, which play quite a different role from random fancies, or"

"13010","                     Possible, Potential, and Preposterous Pathways"

"13012","brain-which are taken routinely in going from one place to another. There are other"
"13013","pathways which can only be followed if one is led through them by the hand. These"
"13014","pathways are ""potential pathways"", which would be followed only if special external"
"13015","circumstances arose. The pathways which one relies on over and over again are pathways"
"13016","which incorporate knowledge-and here I mean not only knowledge of facts (declarative"
"13017","knowledge), but also knowledge of how-to's (procedural knowledge). These stable,"
"13018","reliable pathways are what constitute knowledge. Pieces of knowledge merge gradually"
"13019","with beliefs, which are also represented by reliable pathways, but perhaps ones which are"
"13020","more susceptible to replacement if, so to speak, a bridge goes out, or there is heavy fog."
"13021","This leaves us with fancies, lies, falsities, absurdities, and other variants. These would"
"13022","correspond to peculiar routes such as: New York City to Newark via Bangor, Maine and"
"13023","Lubbock, Texas. They are indeed possible pathways, but ones which are not likely to be"

"13044","translation is, ""She had a bowl of borscht."" Now perhaps many of your readers will have"
"13045","no idea what borscht is. You could attempt to replace it by the ""corresponding"" item in"
"13046","their culture-thus, your translation might run, ""She had a bowl of Campbell's soup."" Now"
"13047","if you think this is a silly exaggeration, take a look at the first sentence of Dostoevsky's"
"13048","novel Crime and Punishment in Russian and then in a few different English translations. I"
"13049","happened to look at three different English paperback translations, and found the"
"13050","following curious situation."
"13051","         The first sentence employs the street name ""S. Pereulok"" (as transliterated). What"
"13052","is the meaning of this? A careful reader of Dostoevsky's work who knows Leningrad"
"13053","(which used to be called ""St. Petersburg""-or should I say ""Petrograd""?) can discover by"
"13054","doing some careful checking of the rest of the geography in the book (which incidentally"
"13055","is also given only by its initials) that the street must be ""Stoliarny Pereulok"". Dostoevsky"
"13056","probably wished to tell his story in a realistic way, yet not so realistically that people"
"13057","would take literally the addresses at which crimes and other events were supposed to"
"13058","have occurred. In any case, we have a translation problem; or to be more precise, we have"
"13059","several translation problems, on several different levels."
"13060","         First of all, should we keep the initial so as to reproduce the aura of semi-mystery"
"13061","which appears already in this first sentence of the book? We would get ""S. Lane"" (""lane"""
"13062","being the standard translation of ""pereulok""). None of the three translators took this tack."
"13063","However, one chose to write ""S. Place"". The translation of Crime and Punishment which"
"13064","I read in high school took a similar option. I will never forget the disoriented feeling I"
"13065","experienced when I began reading the novel and encountered those streets with only"
"13066","letters for names. I had some sort of intangible malaise about the beginning of the book; I"
"13067","was sure that I was missing something essential, and yet I didn't know what it was ... I"
"13068","decided that all Russian novels were very weird."
"13069","         Now we could be frank with the reader (who, it may be assumed, probably won't"
"13070","have the slightest idea whether the street is real or fictitious anyway!) and give him the"
"13071","advantage of our modern scholarship, writing"
"13072","Minds and Thoughts                                                                       385"

"13074","""Stoliarny Lane"" (or ""Place""). This was the choice of translator number 2, who gave the"
"13075","translation as ""Stoliarny Place""."
"13076","         What about number 3? This is the most interesting of all. This translation says"
"13077","""Carpenter's Lane"". And why not, indeed? After all, ""stoliar"" means ""carpenter"" and ""ny"""
"13078","is an adjectival ending. So now we might imagine ourselves in London, not Petrograd,"
"13079","and in the midst of a situation invented by Dickens, not Dostoevsky. Is that what we"
"13080","want-, Perhaps we should just read a novel by Dickens instead, with the justification that"
"13081","it is ""the corresponding work in English"". When viewed on a sufficiently high level, it is"
"13082","a ""translation"" of the Dostoevsky novel-in fact, the best possible one! Who needs"
"13083","Dostoevsky?"
"13084","         We have come all the way from attempts at great literal fidelity to the author's"
"13085","style, to high-level translations of flavor. Now if this happens already in the first"

"13087","point where a German landlady begins shouting in her German-style Russian% How do"
"13088","you translate broken Russian spoken with a German accent, into English?"
"13089","         Then one may also consider the problems of how to translate slang and colloquial"
"13090","modes of expression. Should one search for an ""analogous"" phrase, or should one settle"
"13091","for a word-by-word translation? If you search for an analogous phrase, then you run the"
"13092","risk of committing a ""Campbell's soup"" type of blunder; but if you translate every"
"13093","idiomatic phrase word by word, then the English will sound alien. Perhaps this is"
"13094","desirable, since the Russian culture is an alien one to speakers of English. But a speaker"
"13095","of English who reads such a translation will constantly be experiencing, thanks to the"
"13096","unusual turns of phrase, a sense-an artificial sense-of strangeness, which was not intended"
"13097","by the author, and which is not experienced by readers of the Russian original."
"13098","         Problems such as these give one pause in considering such statements as this one,"
"13099","made by Warren Weaver, one of the first advocates of translation by computer, in the late"
"13100","1940's: ""When I look at an article in Russian, I say, 'This is really written in English, but"

"13117","its home computer."
"13118","        Now we have two machine language programs. But there is another problem:"
"13119","there are two computers, hence two different machine languages-and they may be"

"13212","         Now in an ASU, there are many trips which could be taken along two or more"
"13213","reasonable alternative routes. For example, the trip from San Francisco to New York"
"13214","could go along either a northern route or a southern route. Each of them is quite"

"13227","of the brain state which is worth its salt must contain all such conflicting versions."
"13228","Actually this is quite obvious-that we all are bundles of contradictions, and we manage to"
"13229","hang together by bringing out only one side of ourselves at a given time. The selection"
"13230","cannot be predicted in advance, because the conditions which will force the selection are"

"13433","ingredients together in coming up with his opinions. The following excerpt is quite"
"13434","relevant to what we have just been discussing:"
"13435","   At one's first and simplest attempts to philosophize, one becomes entangled in questions of"
"13436","   whether when one knows something one knows that one knows it, and what, when one is"
"13437","   thinking of oneself, is being thought about, and what is doing the thinking. After one has"

"13439","   questions: the concept of a conscious being is, implicitly, realized to be different from that"
"13440","   of an unconscious object. In saying that a conscious being knows something, we are saying"
"13441","   not onh that he knows it, but that he knows that he knows it, and that he knows that he"

"13447","  questions are felt to be pointless because the concept contains within itself the idea of"
"13448","  being able to go on answering such questions indefinitely. Although conscious beings have"
"13449","  the power of going on, we do not wish to exhibit this simply as a succession of tasks they"
"13450","  are able to perform, nor do we see the mind as an infinite sequence of selves and super-"

"13452","  though we talk about parts of the mind, we (to so only as a metaphor, and will not allow it"
"13453","  to be taken literally."
"13454","        The paradoxes of consciousness arise because a conscious being can be aware of itself"
"13455","  as well as of other things, and yet cannot really be construed as being divisible into parts. It"
"13456","  means that a conscious being can deal with Gödelian questions in a was in which a"
"13457","  machine cannot, because a conscious being can both consider itself and its perform a rice"

"13464","        The thesis thus begins to become more of a matter of conceptual analysis than"

"13475","  difference appears, so that ""super-critical"" machines will be quite unlike the simple ones"

"13664","Tortoise: No, it hasn't. But there have been some remarkable near misses. For instance, in"
"13665","    1931 the Russian number theorist Schnirelmann proved that any number-even or"
"13666","    odd-can be represented as the sum of not more than 300,000 primes."
"13667","Achilles: What a strange result. Of what good is it?"
"13668","Tortoise: It has brought the problem into the domain of the finite. Previous to"
"13669","    Schnirelmann's proof, it was conceivable that as you took larger and larger even"
"13670","    numbers, they would require more and more primes to represent them. Some even"
"13671","    number might take a trillion primes to represent it! Now it is known that that is not"
"13672","    so-a sum of 300,000 primes (or fewer) will always suffice."
"13673","Achilles: I see."
"13674","Tortoise: Then in 1937, a sly fellow named Vinogradov-a Russian too-managed to"

"13676","    ODD number can be represented as a sum of no more than THREE odd primes. For"
"13677","    example, 1937 = 641 + 643 + 653. We could say that an odd number which is"

"13682","Achilles: Very well-but what does ""sufficiently large"" mean?"

"13690","Achilles: I see. And so any sufficiently large even number 2N can be represented as a"
"13691","    sum of FOUR primes, by first representing 2N - 3 as a sum of three primes, and then"
"13692","    adding back the prime number 3."
"13693","Tortoise: Precisely. Another close approach is contained in the Theorem which says, ""All"
"13694","    even numbers can be represented as a sum of one prime and one number which is a"
"13695","    product of at most two primes."""
"13696","Achilles: This question about sums of two primes certainly leads you into strange"
"13697","    territory. I wonder where you would be led if you looked at DIFFERENCES of two"
"13698","    odd primes. I'll bet I could glean some insight into this teaser by making a little table"
"13699","    of even numbers, and their representations as differences of two odd primes, just as I"
"13700","    did for sums. Let's see ..."
"13701","         2= 5-3,       7-5,            13-11,         19-17, etc."
"13702","         4 = 7 - 3,    11 - 7,         17 - 13,       23 - 19,etc."

"13704","         8 = 11 - 3,   13 - 5,         19 - 11,       31 - 23,etc."
"13705","         10 = 13 - 3,  17 - 7,         23 - 13,       29- 19, etc."
"13706","My gracious! There seems to be no end to the number of different representations I can"
"13707","    find for these even numbers. Yet I don't discern any simple regularity in the table so"
"13708","    far."
"13709","Tortoise: Perhaps there is no regularity to be discerned."
"13710","Achilles: Oh, you and your constant rumblings about chaos! I'll hear none of that, thank"
"13711","    you."
"13712","Tortoise: Do you suppose that EVERY even number can be represented somehow as the"
"13713","    difference of two odd primes?"
"13714","Achilles: The answer certainly would appear to be yes, from my table. But then again, I"
"13715","    suppose it could also be no. That doesn't really get us very far, does it?"
"13716","Tortoise: With all due respect, I would say there are deeper insights to be had on the"
"13717","    matter."
"13718","Achilles: Curious how similar this problem is to Goldbach's original one. Perhaps it"
"13719","    should be called a ""Goldbach Variation""."
"13720","Tortoise: Indeed. But you know, there is a rather striking difference between the"
"13721","    Goldbach Conjecture, and this Goldbach Variation, which I would like to tell you"
"13722","    about. Let us say that an even number 2N has the “Goldbach property” if it is the"
"13723","    SUM of two odd primes, and it has the “Tortoise property” if it is the DIFFERENCE"
"13724","    of two odd primes"
"13725","Aria with Diverse Variations                                                             401"

"13727","Achilles: I think you should call it the ""Achilles property"". After all, I suggested the"
"13728","    problem."
"13729","Tortoise: I was just about to propose that we should say that a number which LACKS the"
"13730","    Tortoise property has the ""Achilles property"". Achilles: Well, all right .. ."
"13731","Tortoise: Now consider, for instance, whether I trillion has the Goldbach property or the"
"13732","    Tortoise property. Of course, it may have both."
"13733","Achilles: I can consider it, but I doubt whether I can give you an answer to either"
"13734","    question."
"13735","Tortoise: Don't give up so soon. Suppose I asked you to answer one or the other question."
"13736","    Which one would you pick to work on?"
"13737","Achilles: I suppose I would flip a coin. I don't see much difference between them."
"13738","Tortoise: Aha: But there's a world of difference' If you pick the Goldbach property,"
"13739","    involving SUMS of primes, then you are limited to using primes which are bounded"
"13740","    between 2 and 1 trillion, right?"
"13741","Achilles: Of course."
"13742","Tortoise: So your search for a representation for 1 trillion as a sum of two primes is"
"13743","    GUARANTEED TO TERMINATE."
"13744","Achilles: Ahhh! I see your point. Whereas if I chose to work on representing 1 trillion as"
"13745","    the DIFFERENCE of two primes, I would not have any bound on the size of the"
"13746","    primes involved. They might be so big that it would take me a trillion years to find"
"13747","    them."
"13748","Tortoise: Or then again, they might not even EXIST! After all, that's what the question"
"13749","    was asking-do such primes exist, It wasn't of much concern how big they might turn"
"13750","    out to be."
"13751","Achilles: You're right. If they didn't exist, then a search process would lead on forever,"
"13752","    never answering yes, and never answering no. And nevertheless, the answer would"
"13753","    be no."
"13754","Tortoise: So if you have some number, and you wish to test whether it has the Goldbach"
"13755","    property or the Tortoise property, the difference between the two tests will be this: in"
"13756","    the former, the search involved is GUARANTEED TO TERMINATE; in the latter,"
"13757","    it is POTENTIALLY ENDLESS-there are no guarantees of any type. It might just"
"13758","    go merrily on forever, without yielding an answer. And yet, on the other hand, in"
"13759","    some cases, it might stop on the first step."
"13760","Achilles: I see there is a rather vast difference between the Goldbach and Tortoise"
"13761","    properties."
"13762","Tortoise: Yes, the two similar problems concern these vastly different properties. The"
"13763","    Goldbach Conjecture is to the effect that all even numbers have the Goldbach"

"13765","    property. Both problems are unsolved, but what is interesting is that although they"
"13766","    sound very much alike, they involve properties of whole numbers which are quite"

"13775","Tortoise: Well, there may be cleverer ways of searching in the case of the Tortoise"
"13776","    property, and maybe following one of them would always come to an end, and yield"
"13777","    an answer."
"13778","Achilles: Couldn't the search only end if the answer were yes%"
"13779","Tortoise: Not necessarily. There might be some way of proving that whenever the search"
"13780","    lasts longer than a certain length of time, then the answer must be no. There might"
"13781","    even be some OTHER way of searching for the primes, not such a brute force way,"
"13782","    which is guaranteed to find them if they exist, and to tell if they don't. In either case,"
"13783","    a finite search would be able to yield the answer no. But I don't know if such a thing"
"13784","    can be proven or not. Searching through infinite spaces is always a tricky matter, you"
"13785","    know."
"13786","Achilles: So as things stand now, you know of no test for the Tortoise property which is"
"13787","    guaranteed to terminate-and yet there MIGHT exist such a search."
"13788","Tortoise: Right. I suppose one could embark on a search for such a search, but I can give"
"13789","    no guarantee that that ""meta-search"" would terminate, either."
"13790","Achilles: You know, it strikes me as quite peculiar that if some even number-for"
"13791","    example, a trillion-failed to have the Tortoise property, it would be caused by an"
"13792","    infinite number of separate pieces of information. It's funny to think of wrapping all"
"13793","    that information up into one bundle, and calling it, as you so gallantly suggested,"
"13794","    ""the Achilles property"" of 1 trillion. It is really a property of the number system as a"

"13796","Tortoise: That is an interesting observation, Achilles, but I maintain that it makes a good"
"13797","    deal of sense to attach this fact to the number 1 trillion nevertheless. For purposes of"
"13798","    illustration, let me suggest that you . consider the simpler statement ""29 is prime""."

"13800","    29, and so forth, doesn't it?"
"13801","Achilles: It must, I suppose."
"13802","Tortoise: But you are perfectly happy to collect all such facts together, and attach them in"
"13803","    a bundle to the number 29, saying merely, ""29 is prime"""
"13804","Achilles: Yes ..."
"13805","Tortoise: And the number of facts involved is actually infinite, isn't it:, After all, such"
"13806","    facts as ""4444 times 3333 is not 29"" are all part of it, aren't they%"
"13807","Achilles: Strictly speaking, I suppose so. But you and I both know that you can't produce"
"13808","    29 by multiplying two numbers which are both bigger than 29. So in reality, saying"
"13809","    ""29 is prime"" is only summarizing a FINITE number of facts about multiplication"
"13810","Aria with Diverse Variations                                                              403"

"13812","Tortoise: You can put it that way if you want, but think of this: the fact that two numbers"
"13813","    which are bigger than 29 can't have a product equal to 29 involves the entire"
"13814","    structure of the number system. In that sense, that fact in itself is a summary of an"
"13815","    infinite number of facts. You can't get away from the fact, Achilles, that when you"
"13816","    say ""29 is prime'-', you are actually stating an infinite number of things."
"13817","Achilles: Maybe so, but it feels like just one fact to me."
"13818","Tortoise: That's because an infinitude of facts are contained in your prior knowledge-they"
"13819","    are embedded implicitly in the way you visualize things. You don't see an explicit"
"13820","    infinity because it is captured implicitly inside the images you manipulate."
"13821","Achilles: I guess that you're right. It still seems odd to lump a property of the entire"
"13822","    number system into a unit, and label the unit ""primeness of 29"""
"13823","Tortoise: Perhaps it seems odd, but it is also quite a convenient way to look at things."
"13824","    Now let us come back to your hypothetical idea. If, as you suggested, the number 1"
"13825","    trillion has the Achilles property, then no matter what prime you add to it, you do not"
"13826","    get another prime. Such a state of affairs would be caused by an infinite number of"
"13827","    separate mathematical ""events"". Now do all these ""events"" necessarily spring from"
"13828","    the same source? Do they have to have a common cause? Because if they don't, then"
"13829","    some sort of ""infinite coincidence"" has created the fact, rather than an underlying"
"13830","    regularity."
"13831","Achilles: An ""infinite coincidence""? Among the natural numbers, NoTHING is"
"13832","    coincidental-nothing happens without there being some underlying pattern. Take 7,"
"13833","    instead of a trillion. I can deal with it more easily, because it is smaller. 7 has the"
"13834","    Achilles property."
"13835","Tortoise: You're sure?"
"13836","Achilles: Yes. Here's why. If you add 2 to it, you get 9, which isn't prime. And if you add"
"13837","    any other prime to 7, you are adding two odd numbers, resulting in an even number-"
"13838","    thus you again fail to get a prime. So here the ""Achilleanity"" of 7, to coin a term, is a"

"13840","    just goes to support my assertion: that it never takes an infinite number of reasons to"
"13841","    account for some arithmetical truth. If there WERE some arithmetical fact which"
"13842","    were caused by an infinite collection of unrelated coincidences, then you could never"

"13846","Achilles: Are there actually those who disagree with this view? Such people would have"

"13960","Achilles: Oh, how exciting! What is it called?"
"13961","Tortoise: Copper, Silver, Gold: an Indestructible Metallic Alloy. Doesn't that sound"
"13962","    interesting?"
"13963","Achilles: Frankly, I'm a little confused by the title. After all, what do Copper, Silver, and"
"13964","    Gold have to do with each other? Tortoise: It seems clear to me."
"13965","Achilles: Now if the title were, say, Giraffes, Silver, Gold, or Copper, Elephants, Gold,"
"13966","    why, I could see it .. ."
"13967","Tortoise: Perhaps you would prefer Copper, Silver, Baboons?"
"13968","Achilles: Oh, absolutely! But that original title is a loser. No one would understand it."
"13969","Tortoise: I'll tell my friend. He'll be delighted to have a catchier title (as will his"
"13970","    publisher)."
"13971","Achilles: I'm glad. But how were you reminded of his book by our discussion?"
"13972","Tortoise: Ah, yes. You see, in his book there will be a Dialogue in which he wants to"
"13973","    throw readers off by making them SEARCH for the ending."
"13974","Achilles: A funny thing to want to do. How is it done?"
"13975","Tortoise: You've undoubtedly noticed how some authors go to so much trouble to build"
"13976","    up great tension a few pages before the end of their stories-but a reader who is"
"13977","    holding the book physically in his hands can FEEL that the story is about to end."
"13978","    Hence, he has some extra information which acts as an advance warning, in a way."
"13979","    The tension is a bit spoiled by the physicality of the book. It would be so much better"
"13980","    if, for instance, there were a lot of padding at the end of novels."
"13981","Achilles: Padding?"
"13982","Tortoise: Yes; what I mean is, a lot of extra printed pages which are not part of the story"
"13983","    proper, but which serve to conceal the exact location of the end from a cursory"
"13984","    glance, or from the feel of the book."
"13985","Achilles: I see. So a story's true ending might occur, say, fifty or a hundred pages before"
"13986","    the physical end of the book?"
"13987","Tortoise: Yes. This would provide an element of surprise, because the reader wouldn't"
"13988","    know in advance how many pages are padding, and how many are story."
"13989","Achilles: If this were standard practice, it might be quite effective. But"
"13990","Aria with Diverse Variations                                                              408"
"13991",""
"13992","    there is a problem. Suppose your padding were very obvious-such as a lot of blanks,"
"13993","    or pages covered with X's or random letters. Then, it would be as good as absent."
"13994","Tortoise: Granted. You'd have to make it resemble normal printed pages."
"13995","Achilles: But even a cursory glance at a normal page from one story will often suffice to"
"13996","    distinguish it from another story. So you will have to make the padding resemble the"
"13997","    genuine story rather closely."
"13998","Tortoise: That's quite true. The way I've always envisioned it is this: you bring the story"
"13999","    to an end; then without any break, you follow it with something which looks like a"
"14000","    continuation but which is in reality just padding, and which is utterly unrelated to the"
"14001","    true theme. The padding is, in a way, a ""post-ending ending"". It may contain"
"14002","    extraneous literary ideas, having little to do with the original theme."
"14003","Achilles: Sneaky! But then the problem is that you won't be able to tell when the real"
"14004","    ending comes. It'll just blend right into the padding."
"14005","Tortoise: That's the conclusion my author friend and I have reached as well. It's a shame,"
"14006","    for I found the idea rather appealing."
"14007","Achilles: Say, I have a suggestion. The transition between genuine story and padding"
"14008","    material could be made in such a way that, by sufficiently assiduous inspection of"
"14009","    the text, an intelligent reader will be able to detect where one leaves off and the other"
"14010","    begins. Perhaps it will take him quite a while. Perhaps there will be no way to"
"14011","    predict how long it will take ... But the publisher could give a guarantee that a"
"14012","    sufficiently assiduous search for the true ending will always terminate, even if he"
"14013","    can't say how long it will be before the test terminates."
"14014","Tortoise: Very well-but what does ""sufficiently assiduous"" mean?"
"14015","Achilles: It means that the reader must be on the lookout for some small but telltale"
"14016","    feature in the text which occurs at some point. That would signal the end. And he"
"14017","    must be ingenious enough to think up, and hunt for, many such features until he"
"14018","    finds the right one."
"14019","Tortoise: Such as a sudden shift of letter frequencies or word lengths? Or a rash of"
"14020","    grammatical mistakes?"
"14021","Achilles: Possibly. Or a hidden message of some sort might reveal the true end to a"
"14022","    sufficiently assiduous reader. Who knows? One could even throw in some"
"14023","    extraneous characters or events which are inconsistent with the spirit of the"
"14024","    foregoing story. A naive reader would swallow the whole thing, whereas a"
"14025","    sophisticated reader would be able to spot the dividing line exactly."
"14026","Tortoise: That's a most original idea, Achilles. I'll relay it to my friend, and perhaps he"
"14027","    can incorporate it in his Dialogue."
"14028","Achilles: I would be highly honored."
"14029","Tortoise: Well, I am afraid that I myself am growing a little groggy, Achilles. It would be"

"14106","         We seem to be making a rather abrupt transition from brains and hinds to"
"14107","technicalities of mathematics and computer science. Though the transition is abrupt in"
"14108","some ways, it makes some sense. We just saw how a certain kind of self-awareness"
"14109","seems to be at the crux of consciousness. Vow we are going to scrutinize ""self-"
"14110","awareness"" in more formal settings, such as TNT. The gulf between TNT and a mind is"
"14111","wide, but some of the ideas will be most illuminating, and perhaps metaphorically"
"14112","transportable back to our thoughts about consciousness."
"14113","         One of the amazing things about TNT's self-awareness is that it is intimately"
"14114","connected to questions about order versus chaos among the natural numbers. In"
"14115","particular, we shall see that an orderly system of sufficient complexity that it can mirror"
"14116","itself cannot be totally orderly-it must contain some strange, chaotic features. For readers"
"14117","who have some Achilles in them, this will be hard to take. However, there is a ""magical"""

"14135","requires ""sufficiently hi-fi"" record players."
"14136","        Ditto for formal versions of number theory. The reason that TNT is a"
"14137","formalization of N is that its symbols act the right way: that is, its theorems are not silent"
"14138","like a refrigerator-they speak actual truths of N. Of course, so do the theorems of the pq-"
"14139","system. Does it, too, count as ""a formalization of number theory"", or is it more like a"
"14140","refrigerator? Well, it is a little better than a refrigerator, but it is still pretty weak. The pq-"
"14141","system does not include enough of the core truths of N to count as ""a number theory""."
"14142","        What, then, are these ""core truths"" of N? They are the primitive recursive truths;"
"14143","that means they involve only predictably terminating calculations. These core truths"
"14144","serve for N as Euclid's first four postulates served for geometry: they allow you to throw"
"14145","out certain candidates before the game begins, on the grounds of ""insufficient power""."
"14146","From here on out, the representability of all primitive recursive truths will be the"
"14147","criterion for calling a system ""sufficiently powerful""."
"14148","                             Ganto's Ax in Metamathematics"
"14149","The significance of the notion is shown by the following key fact: If you have a"
"14150","sufficiently powerful formalization of number theory, then Gödel’s method is applicable,"
"14151","and consequently your system is incomplete. If, on the other hand, your system is not"
"14152","sufficiently powerful (i.e., not all primitive recursive truths are theorems), then your"
"14153","system is, precisely by virtue of that lack, incomplete. Here we have a reformulation of"
"14154","""Ganto's Ax"" in metamathematics: whatever the system does, Gödel’s Ax will chop its"
"14155","head off! Notice also how this completely parallels the high-fidelity-versus-low fidelity"
"14156","battle in the Contracrostipunctus."
"14157","Actually, it turns out that much weaker systems are still vulnerable to the Gödel method;"
"14158","the criterion that all primitive recursive truths need be represented as theorems is far too"
"14159","stringent. It is a little like a thief who will only rob ""sufficiently rich"" people, and whose"
"14160","criterion is that the potential victim should be carrying at least a million dollars in cash."
"14161","In the case of TNT, luckily, we will be able to act in our capacity as thieves, for the"
"14162","million in cash is there-which is to say, TNT does indeed contain all primitive recursive"

"14165","and predicates, I would like to tie thee themes of this Chapter to themes from earlier"

"14167","                     Finding Order by Choosing the Right Filter"

"14173","showed that any search for a string having a special typographical property has an"

"14175","arithmetical property. Consequently, the quest for decision procedures for formal systems"
"14176","involves solving the mystery of unpredictably long searches- chaos-among the integers."
"14177","Now in the Aria with Diverse Variations, I gave perhaps too much weight to apparent"

"14182","it reflects the beliefs of nearly all mathematicians up till the 1930's. To show why order"
"14183","versus chaos is such a subtle and significant issue, and to tie it in with questions about the"
"14184","location and revelation of meaning, I would like to quote a beautiful and memorable"
"14185","passage from Are Quanta Real?-a Galilean Dialogue by the late J. M. Jauch:"
"14186","          SALVIATI Suppose I give you two sequences of numbers, such as"
"14187","                  78539816339744830961566084..."
"14188","   And"
"14189","                  1, -1/3, +1/5, -1/7, +1/9, -1/11, +1/13, -1/15, ..."
"14190","       If I asked you, Simplicio, what the next number of the first sequence is, what"
"14191","   would you say?"
"14192","       SIMPLICIO I could not tell you. I think it is a random sequence and that there is"
"14193","   no law in it."
"14194","       SALVIATI And for the second sequence?"
"14195","       SIMPLICIO That would be easy. It must be +1/17."
"14196","       SALVIATI Right. But what would you say if I told you that the first"
"14197","       sequence is also constructed by a law and this law is in fact identical with the"
"14198","       one you have just discovered for the second sequence? SIMPLICIO This does not"
"14199","   seem probable to me."
"14200","       SALVIATI But it is indeed so, since the first sequence is simply the beginning of"
"14201","   the decimal fraction [expansion] of the sum of the second. Its value is Tr/4."
"14202","       SIMPLICIO You are full of such mathematical tricks, but I do not see what this"
"14203","   has to do with abstraction and reality."
"14204","       SALVIATI The relationship with abstraction is easy to see. The first sequence"
"14205","   looks random unless one has developed through a process of abstraction a kind of"
"14206","   filter which sees a simple structure behind the apparent randomness."
"14207","       It is exactly in this manner that laws of nature are discovered. Nature"
"14208","       presents us with a host of phenomena which appear mostly as chaotic randomness"
"14209","   until we select some significant events, and abstract from their particular, irrelevant"
"14210","   circumstances so that they become idealized. Only then can they exhibit their true"
"14211","   structure in full splendor."
"14212","       SAGREDO This is a marvelous idea! It suggests that when we try to understand"
"14213","   nature, we should look at the phenomena as if they were messages to be"
"14214","BlooP and FlooP and GlooP                                                                 415"
"14215",""
"14216","   understood. Except that each message appears to be random until we establish a code"
"14217","   to read it. This code takes the form of an abstraction, that is, we choose to ignore"
"14218","   certain things as irrelevant and we thus partially select the content of the message by"
"14219","   a free choice. These irrelevant signals form the ""background noise,"" which will limit"
"14220","   the accuracy of our message."
"14221","       But since the code is not absolute there may be several messages in the same raw"
"14222","   material of the data, so changing the code will result in a message of' equally deep"
"14223","   significance in something that was merely noise before, and conversely: In a new"
"14224","   code a former message may be devoid of meaning."
"14225","       Thus a code presupposes a free choice among different, complementary aspects,"
"14226","   each of which has equal claim to reality, if I may use this dubious word."
"14227","       Some of these aspects may be completely unknown to us now but they may"
"14228","   reveal themselves to an observer with a different system of abstractions."
"14229","       But tell me, Salviati, how can we then still claim that we discover something out"
"14230","   there in the objective real world? Does this not mean that we are merely creating"
"14231","   things according to our own images and that reality is only within ourselves?"
"14232","       SALVIATI I don't think that this is necessarily so, but it is a question which"
"14233","   requires deeper reflection.'"
"14234","Jauch is here dealing with messages that come not from a ""sentient being"" but from"
"14235","nature itself. The questions that we raised in Chapter VI on the relation of meaning to"
"14236","messages can be raised equally well with messages from nature. Is nature chaotic, or is"

"14248","Our topic will be searches for natural numbers which have various properties. In order to"
"14249","talk about the length of any search, we shall have to define some primordial steps, out of"
"14250","which all searches are built, so that length can be measured in terms of number of steps."
"14251","Some steps which we might consider primordial are:"
"14252","      adding any two natural numbers;"
"14253","      multiplying any two natural numbers;"
"14254","      determining if two numbers are equal;"
"14255","      determining the larger (smaller) of two numbers."

"14258","                               Loops and Upper Bounds"
"14259","If we try to formulate a test for, say, primality in terms of such steps, we shall soon see"
"14260","that we have to include a control structure-that is, descriptions of the order to do things"
"14261","in, when to branch back and try something again, when to skip over a set of steps, when"
"14262","to stop, and similar matters."
"14263","It is typical of any algorithm-that is, a specific delineation of how to carry out a task-that"
"14264","it includes a mixture of (1) specific operations to be performed, and (2) control"
"14265","statements. Therefore, as we develop our language for expressing predictably long"
"14266","calculations, we shall have to incorporate primordial control structures also. In fact, the"
"14267","hallmark of BlooP is its limited set of control structures. It does not allow you to branch"
"14268","to arbitrary steps, or to repeat groups of steps without limit; in BlooP, essentially the only"
"14269","control structure is the bounded loop: a set of instructions which can be executed over"
"14270","and over again, up to a predefined maximum number of times, called the upper bound, or"
"14271","ceiling, of the loop. If the ceiling were 300, then the loop might be executed 0, 7, or 300"
"14272","times-but not 301."
"14273","Now the exact values of all the upper bounds in a program need not be put in numerically"
"14274","by the programmer-indeed, they may not be known in advance. Instead, any upper bound"
"14275","may be determined by calculations carried out before its loop is entered. For instance, if"
"14276","you wanted to calculate the value of 2""', there would be two loops. First, you evaluate 3"","
"14277","which involves n multiplications. Then, you put 2 to that power, which involves 3"""
"14278","multiplications. Thus, the upper bound for the second loop is the result of the calculation"
"14279","of the first loop."

"14301","scrutiny. A procedure is defined, having one input parameter, N; its output is the desired"
"14302","value."
"14303","         This procedure definition has what is called block structure, which means that"
"14304","certain portions of it are to be considered as units, or blocks. All the statements in a block"
"14305","get executed as a unit. Each block has a number (the outermost being BLOCK 0), and is"
"14306","delimited by a BEGIN and an END. In our example, BLOCK 1 and BLOCK 2 contain"
"14307","just one statement each but shortly you will see longer blocks. A LOOP statement always"
"14308","means to execute the block immediately under it repeatedly. As can be seen above,"
"14309","blocks can be nested."
"14310","         The strategy of the above algorithm is as described earlier. You begin by taking"
"14311","an auxiliary variable, called CELL(O); you set it initially to 1, and then, in a loop, you"
"14312","multiply it repeatedly by 3 until you've done so exactly N times. Next, you do the"
"14313","analogous thing for CELL(1)-set it to 1, multiply by 2 exactly CELL(O) times, then"
"14314","quit. Finally, you set OUTPUT to the value of CELL(1). This is the value returned to the"
"14315","outside world-the only externally visible behavior of the procedure."
"14316","         A number of points about the notation should be made here. First, the meaning of"
"14317","the left-arrow <= is this:"
"14318","Evaluate the expression to its right, then take the result and set the CELL (or OUTPUT)"
"14319","             on its left to that value."
"14320","So the meaning of a command such as CELL(1) <= 3 X CELL(1) is to triple the value"
"14321","stored in CELL(1). You may think of each CELL as being a separate word in the"
"14322","memory of some computer. The only difference between a CELL and a true word is that"
"14323","the latter can only hold integers up to some finite limit, whereas we allow a CELL to"
"14324","hold any natural number, no matter how big."
"14325","         Every procedure in BlooP, when called, yields a value-namely the value of the"
"14326","variable called OUTPUT. At the beginning of execution of any procedure, it is assumed"
"14327","as a default option that OUTPUT has the value 0. That way, even if the procedure never"
"14328","resets OUTPUT at all, OUTPUT has a well-defined value at all times."
"14329","                              IF-Statements and Branching"
"14330","Now let us look at another procedure which will show us some other features of BlooP"
"14331","which give it more generality. How do you find out, knowing only how to add, what the"

"14333","which yields M. However, what happens if M is smaller than N? What if we are trying to"
"14334","take 5 from 2? In the domain of natural numbers, there is no answer. But we would like"

"14350","         Here we are making use of the implicit feature that OUTPUT begins at 0. If M is"
"14351","less than N, then the subtraction is impossible, and we simply jump to the bottom of"
"14352","BLOCK 0 right away, and the answer is 0. That is what is meant by the line QUIT"
"14353","BLOCK 0. But if M is not less than N, then we skip over that QUIT-statement, and"
"14354","carry out the next command in sequence (here, a LOOP-statement). That is how IF-"

"14356","         So we enter LOOP 1, so called because the block which it tells us to repeat is"
"14357","BLOCK 1. We try adding 0 to N, then 1, 2, etc., until we find a number that gives M. At"
"14358","that point, we ABORT the loop we are in, meaning we jump to the statement"
"14359","immediately following the END which marks the bottom of the loop's block. In this case,"
"14360","that jump brings us just below BLOCK 1: END, which is to say, to the last statement of"

"14362","         Notice that there are two distinct instructions for jumping downwards: QUIT, and"
"14363","ABORT. The former pertains to blocks, the latter to loops. QUIT BLOCK n means to"
"14364","jump to the last line of BLOCK n, whereas ABORT LOOP n means to jump just below"
"14365","the last line of BLOCK n. This distinction only matters when you are inside a loop and"
"14366","want to continue looping but to quit the block this time around. Then you can say QUIT"
"14367","and the proper thing will happen."
"14368","         Also notice that the words AT MOST now precede the upper bound of the loop,"

"14371","Now there are two last features of BlooP to explain, both of them very important. The"
"14372","first is that, once a procedure has been defined, it may be called inside later procedure"
"14373","definitions. The effect of this is that once an operation has been defined in a procedure, it"
"14374","is considered as simple as a primordial step. Thus, BlooP features automatic chunking."
"14375","You might compare it to the way a good ice skater acquires new motions: not by defining"
"14376","them as long sequences of primordial muscle-actions, but in terms of previously learned"
"14377","motions, which were themselves learned as compounds of earlier"
"14378","BlooP and FlooP and GlooP                                                               419"
"14379",""
"14380","learned motions, etc.-and the nestedness, or chunkedness, can go back many layers until"
"14381","you hit primordial muscle-actions And thus, the repertoire of BlooP programs, like the"

"14383","                                         BlooP Tests"
"14384","The other feature of BlooP is that certain procedures can have YES or NO as their"
"14385","output, instead of an integer value. Such procedures are tests, rather than functions. To"
"14386","indicate the difference, the name of a test must terminate in a question mark. Also, in a"

"14404","REMAINDER. (The latter is presumed to have been previously defined, and you may"
"14405","work out its definition yourself.) Now this test for primality works by trying out potential"
"14406","factors of N one by one, starting at 2 and increasing to a maximum of N - 1. In case any"
"14407","of them divides N exactly (i.e., gives remainder 0), then we jump down to the bottom,"
"14408","and since OUTPUT still has its default value at this stage, the answer is NO. Only if N"

"14412","                 BlooP Programs Contain Chains of Procedures"
"14413","We have seen how to define procedures in BlooP; however, a procedure definition is only"
"14414","a part of a program. A program consists of a chain of procedure definitions (each only"

"14535","Now before we go on to some interesting questions about BlooP and are led to its"
"14536","relative, FlooP, let us return to the reason for introducing BlooP in the first place, and"
"14537","connect it to TNT. Earlier, I stated that the critical mass for Gödel’s method to be"
"14538","applicable to a formal system is attained when all primitive recursive notions are"
"14539","representable in that system. Exactly what does this mean? First of all, we must"
"14540","distinguish between the notions of representability and expressibility. Expressing a"
"14541","predicate is a mere matter of translation from English into a strict formalism. It has"
"14542","nothing to do with theoremhood. For a predicate to be represented, on the other hand, is a"
"14543","much stronger notion. It means that"
"14544","       (1) All true instances of the predicate are theorems;"
"14545","       (2) All false instances are nontheorems."
"14546","By ""instance"", I mean the string produced when you replace all free variables by"
"14547","numerals. For example, the predicate m + n = k is represented in the pq-system, because"
"14548","each true instance of the predicate is a theorem, each false instance is a nontheorem. Thus"
"14549","any specific addition, whether true or false, translates into a decidable string of the pq-"
"14550","system. However, the pq-system is unable to express-let alone represent-any other"
"14551","properties of natural numbers. Therefore it would be a weak candidate indeed in a"
"14552","competition of systems which can do number theory."
"14553","         Now TNT has the virtue of being able to express virtually any number-theoretical"
"14554","predicate; for example, it is easy to write a TNT-string which expresses the predicate ""b"
"14555","has the Tortoise property"". Thus, in terms of expressive power, TNT is all we want."
"14556","         However, the question ""Which properties are represented in TNT?"" is Precisely"
"14557","the question ""How powerful an axiomatic system is TNT?"" Are all Possible predicates"
"14558","represented in TNT? If so, then TNT can answer any question of number theory; it is"
"14559","complete."
"14560","           Primitive Recursive Predicates Are Represented in TNT"
"14561","Now although completeness will turn out to be a chimera. TNT is at least complete with"

"14563","whose truth or falsity can be decided by a"
"14564","BlooP and FlooP and GlooP                                                               424"

"14569","       property is represented in TNT."
"14570","           Are There Functions Which Are Not Primitive Recursive?"
"14571","Now the kinds of properties which can be detected by BlooP tests are widely varied,"
"14572","including whether a number is prime or perfect, has the Goldbach property, is a power of"
"14573","2, and so on and so forth. It would not be crazy to wonder whether every property of"
"14574","numbers can be detected by some suitable BlooP program. The fact that, as of the present"
"14575","moment, we have no way of testing whether a number is wondrous or not need not"
"14576","disturb us too much, for it might merely mean that we are ignorant about wondrousness,"
"14577","and that with more digging around, we could discover a universal formula for the upper"
"14578","bound to the loop involved. Then a BlooP test for wondrousness could be written on the"
"14579","spot. Similar remarks could be made about the Tortoise property."
"14580","         So the question really is, ""Can upper bounds always be given for the length of"

"14649","The strategy is: feed each meat grinder with its own index number, then add 1 to the"
"14650","output. To illustrate, let us find Bluediag [12]. We saw that Blueprogram{# 12} is the"
"14651","function 2N; therefore, Bluediag [12] must have the value 1 + 2 x 12, or 25. Likewise,"
"14652","Bluediag [5000] would have the value 125,000,000,001, since that is 1 more than the"
"14653","cube of 5000. Similarly, you can find Bluediag of any particular argument you wish."
"14654","        The peculiar thing about Bluediag [N] is that it is not represented in the catalogue"
"14655","of Blue Programs. It cannot be. The reason is this. To be a Blue Program, it would have"
"14656","to have an index number-say it were Blue Program # X. This assumption is expressed by"
"14657","writing"
"14658","        Equation (2) ...        Bluediag [N] = Blueprogram{# X} [N]"
"14659","But there is an inconsistency between the equations (1) and (2). It becomes apparent at"
"14660","the moment we try to calculate the value of Bluediag [ X], for we can do so by letting N"
"14661","take the value of X in either of the two equations. If we substitute into equation (1), we"
"14662","get:"

"14689","numbers were made, it would inevitably leave some real numbers out-so that actually, the"
"14690","notion of a complete directory of real numbers is a contradiction in terms."
"14691","        It must be understood that this pertains not just to directories of finite size, but"
"14692","also to directories of infinite size. It is a much deeper result than the statement ""the"
"14693","number of reals is infinite, so of course they cannot be listed in a finite directory"". The"
"14694","essence of Cantor's result is that there are (at least) two distinct types of infinity: one kind"
"14695","of infinity describes how many entries there can be in an infinite directory or table, and"
"14696","another describes how many real numbers there are (i.e., how many points there are on a"
"14697","line, or line segment)-and this latter is ""bigger"", in the sense that the real numbers cannot"
"14698","be squeezed into a table whose length is described by the former kind of infinity. So let"
"14699","us see how Cantor's argument involves the notion of diagonal, in a literal sense."
"14700","        Let us consider just real numbers between 0 and 1. Assume, for the sake of"

"15259","""TNT"" having been substituted for ""Principia Mathematica"". Gödel’s paper was a"
"15260","technical one, concentrating on making his proof watertight and rigorous; this Chapter"
"15261","will be more intuitive, and in it I will stress the two key ideas which are at the core of the"
"15262","proof. The first key idea is the deep discovery that there are strings of TNT which can be"
"15263","interpreted as speaking about other strings of TNT; in short, that TNT, as a language, is"
"15264","capable of ""introspection"", or self-scrutiny. This is what comes from Gödel-numbering."
"15265","The second key idea is that the property of self scrutiny can be entirely concentrated into"
"15266","a single string; thus that string's sole focus of attention is itself. This ""focusing trick"" is"
"15267","traceable, in essence, to the Cantor diagonal method."
"15268","        In my opinion, if one is interested in understanding Gödel’s proof. in a deep way,"
"15269","then one must recognize that the proof, in its essence, consists of a fusion of these two"
"15270","main ideas. Each of them alone is a master stroke; to put them together took an act of"
"15271","genius. If I were to choose, however, which of the two key ideas is deeper, I would"
"15272","unhesitatingly pick the first one-the idea of Gödel-numbering, for that idea is related to"
"15273","the whole notion of what meaning and reference are, in symbol-manipulating systems."
"15274","This is an idea which goes far beyond the confines of mathematical logic, whereas the"
"15275","Cantor trick, rich though it is in mathematical consequences, has little if any relation to"
"15276","issues in real life."
"15277","                              The First Idea: Proof-Pairs"
"15278","Without further ado, then, let us proceed to the elaboration of the proof itself. We have"
"15279","already given a fairly careful notion of what the Gödel isomorphism is about, in Chapter"
"15280","IX. We now shall describe a mathematical notion which allows us to translate a statement"
"15281","such as ""The string 0=0 is a theorem of TNT into a statement of number theory. This will"
"15282","involve the notion of proof-pairs. A proof-pair is a pair of natural numbers related in a"
"15283","particular way. Here is the idea:"

"15800","symbols, despite the fact that we are quite aware that the system is a modified system."
"15801","We want to get away without reinterpreting any symbols-and of course that will prove"

"15803","        The reconciliation comes when we reinterpret 3 as ""There exists a generalized"

"15806","some extra numbers besides the natural numbers. These are the supernatural numbers."
"15807","The naturals and supernaturals together make up the totality of generalized naturals."
"15808","        The apparent contradiction vanishes into thin air, now, for the pyramidal family"

"15850","         Of course, any theorem of TNT has many different derivations, so you might"
"15851","complain that my characterization of I is nonunique. That is so. But the parallel with 1-"

"15932","too simplistically. Physicists are always dealing with approximations and idealizations of"
"15933","situations. For instance, my own Ph.D. work, mentioned in Chapter V, was based on an"
"15934","extreme idealization of the problem of a crystal in a magnetic field. The mathematics"
"15935","which emerged was of a high degree of beauty and symmetry. Despite-or rather, because"
"15936","of-the artificiality of the model, some fundamental features emerged conspicuously in the"

"15938","happen in more realistic situations. But without the simplifying assumptions which"
"15939","produced my graph, there could never be such insights. One can see this kind of thing"
"15940","over and over again in physics, where a physicist uses a ""nonreal"" situation to learn about"

"15948","just the 3-D space we live in. There are whole families of ""abstract spaces"" within which"
"15949","physical calculations take place, spaces which have totally different geometrical"

"15963","economies collapse immediately under the unbearable uncertainty opened up by that"
"15964","fact? Not really. First of all, nonstandard number theory doesn't threaten the age-old idea"
"15965","that 2 plus 2 equals 4. It differs from ordinary number theory only in the way it deals with"
"15966","the concept of the infinite. After all, every theorem of TNT remains a theorem in any"

"15975","theory does not fit the way money works. You fit your mathematics to the world, and not"
"15976","the other way around. For instance, we don't apply number theory to cloud systems,"

"15994","        Now mathematicians have judged that number theory is applicable to the study of"

"15996","arithmetic of real numbers is applicable to their transactions. This is an"
"15997","extramathematical judgement, and shows that the thought processes involved in doing"

"16230","cleverly taken advantage of a hidden defect in one particular formal system, TNT. If this"

"16232","would not be subject to the Gödelian trick, and Gödel’s Theorem would lose much of its"
"16233","sting. In this Chapter we will carefully scrutinize the properties of TNT which made it"
"16234","vulnerable to the arguments of last Chapter."
"16235","         A natural thought is this: If the basic trouble with TNT is that it contains a ""hole""-"
"16236","in other words, a sentence which is undecidable, namely G-then why not simply plug up"
"16237","the hole? Why not just tack G onto TNT as a sixth axiom? Of course, by comparison to"
"16238","the other axioms, G is a ridiculously huge giant, and the resulting system-TNT+G-would"
"16239","have a rather comical aspect due to the disproportionateness of its axioms. Be that as it"
"16240","may, adding G is a reasonable suggestion. Let us consider it done. Now, it is to be hoped,"

"16242","free, but also complete. It is certain that TNT+G is superior to TNT in at least one"
"16243","respect: the string G is no longer undecidable in this new system, since it is a theorem."
"16244","         What was the vulnerability of TNT due to? The essence of its vulnerability was"

"16355","In the Contracrostipunctus, one of the essential steps in the Tortoise's making an"
"16356","""unplayable record"" was to get a hold of a manufacturer's blueprint of the record player"
"16357","which he was out to destroy. This was necessary so that he could figure out to what kinds"
"16358","of vibrations it was vulnerable, and then incorporate into his record such grooves as"
"16359","would code for sounds which would induce those vibrations. It is a close analogue to the"
"16360","Gödel trick, in which the system's own properties are reflected inside the notion of proof-"
"16361","pairs, and then used against it. Any system, no matter how complex or tricky it is, can be"
"16362","Gödel-numbered, and then the notion of its proof-pairs can be defined-and this is the"
"16363","petard by which it is hoist. Once a system is well-defined, or ""boxed"", it becomes"
"16364","vulnerable."
"16365","        This principle is excellently illustrated by the Cantor diagonal trick, which finds"
"16366","an omitted real number for each well-defined list of reals between 0 and 1. It is the act of"
"16367","giving an explicit list-a ""box"" of reals which causes the downfall. Let us see how the"
"16368","Cantor trick can be repeated over and over again. Consider what happens if, starting with"
"16369","some list L, you do the following:"
"16370","        (la) Take list L, and construct its diagonal number d."
"16371","        (lb) Throw d somewhere into list L, making a new list L+d."
"16372","        (2a) Take list L +d, and construct its diagonal number d'."
"16373","        (2b) Throw d' somewhere into list L+d, making a new list L+d+d'."
"16374","Now this step-by-step process may seem a doltish way to patch up L, for we could have"
"16375","made the entire list d, d', d"", d""', ... at once, given L originally. But if you think that"
"16376","making such a list will enable you to complete your list of reals, you are very wrong. The"
"16377","problem comes at the moment you ask, ""Where to incorporate the list of diagonal"
"16378","numbers inside L?"" No matter how diabolically clever a scheme you devise for"
"16379","ensconcing the d-numbers inside L, once you have done it, then the new list is still"
"16380","vulnerable. As was said above, it is the act of giving an explicit list-a ""box"" of reals-that"
"16381","causes the downfall."
"16382","        Now in the case of formal systems, it is the act of giving an explicit recipe for"
"16383","what supposedly characterizes number-theoretical truth that causes the incompleteness."
"16384","This is the crux of the problem with TNT+Gω,. Once you insert all the G's in a well-"
"16385","defined way into TNT, there is seen to be some other G-some unforeseen G-which you"

"16389","        So what is to be done? There is no end in sight. It appears that TNT, even when"

"16398","possibility of constructing, in a given system, an undecidable string via Gödel’s self-"
"16399","reference method, depends on three basic conditions:"
"16400","   (1) That the system should be rich enough so that all desired statements about"
"16401","       numbers, whether true or false, can be expressed in it. (Failure on this count"
"16402","       means that the system is from the very start too weak to be counted as a rival to"
"16403","       TNT, because it can't even express number-theoretical notions that TNT can."
"16404","       In the metaphor of the Contracrosttpunctus, it is as if one did not have a"
"16405","       phonograph but a refrigerator or some other kind of object.)"
"16406","   (2) That all general recursive relations should be represented by formulas in the"
"16407","       system. (Failure on this count means the system fails to capture in a theorem"
"16408","       some general recursive truth, which can only be considered a pathetic bellyflop"
"16409","       if it is attempting to produce all of number theory's truths. In the"
"16410","       Contracrostipunctus metaphor, this is like having a record player, but one of"
"16411","       low fidelity.)"
"16412","   (3) That the axioms and typographical patterns defined by its rules be recognizable"
"16413","       by some terminating decision procedure. (Failure on this count means that there"
"16414","       is no method to distinguish valid derivations in the system from invalid ones-"

"16418","Satisfaction of these three conditions guarantees that any consistent system will be"
"16419","incomplete, because Gödel’s construction is applicable."
"16420","        The fascinating thing is that any such system digs its own hole; the system's own"
"16421","richness brings about its own downfall. The downfall occurs essentially because the"
"16422","system is powerful enough to have self-referential sentences. In physics, the notion exists"
"16423","of a ""critical mass"" of a fissionable substance, such as uranium. A solid lump of the"
"16424","substance will just sit there, if its mass is less than critical. But beyond the critical mass,"
"16425","such a lump will undergo a chain reaction, and blow up. It seems that with formal"
"16426","systems there is an analogous critical point. Below that point, a system is ""harmless"" and"
"16427","does not even approach defining arithmetical truth formally; but beyond the critical point,"
"16428","the system suddenly attains the capacity for self-reference, and thereby dooms itself to"
"16429","incompleteness. The threshold seems to be roughly when a system attains the three"
"16430","properties listed above."

"16436","                            The Passion According to Lucas"
"16437","The baffling repeatability of the Gödel argument has been used by various people-notably"

"16439","quality to human intelligence, which makes it unattainable by ""mechanical automata""-that"
"16440","is, computers. Lucas begins his article ""Minds, Machines, and Gödel"" with these words:"
"16441","         Gödel’s theorem seems to me to prove that Mechanism is false, that is, that minds"
"16442","         cannot be explained as machines.'"
"16443","         Then he proceeds to give an argument which, paraphrased, runs like this. For a"
"16444","computer to be considered as intelligent as a person is, it must be able to do every"
"16445","intellectual task which a person can do. Now Lucas claims that no computer can do"
"16446","""Gödelization"" (one of his amusingly irreverent terms) in the manner that people can."
"16447","Why not? Well, think of any particular formal system, such as TNT, or TNT+G, or even"
"16448","TNT+G.. One can write a computer program rather easily which will systematically"
"16449","generate theorems of that system, and in such a manner that eventually, any preselected"
"16450","theorem will be printed out. That is, the theorem-generating program won't skip any"
"16451","portion of the ""space"" of all theorems. Such a program would be composed of two major"
"16452","parts: (1) a subroutine which stamps out axioms, given the ""molds"" of the axiom schemas"
"16453","(if there are any), and (2) a subroutine which takes known theorems (including axioms, of"
"16454","course) and applies rules of inference to produce new theorems. The program would"
"16455","alternate between running first one of these subroutines, and then the other."
"16456","         We can anthropomorphically say that this program ""knows"" some facts of number"
"16457","theory-namely, it knows those facts which it prints out. If it fails to print out some true"
"16458","fact of number theory, then of course it doesn't ""know"" that fact. Therefore, a computer"

"16477","             never print it out), precisely because of Gödel’s boomeranging argument."
"16478","          This implies that there is one thing which computers just cannot be programmed"

"16481","   However complicated a machine we construct, it will, if it is a machine, correspond"
"16482","   to a formal system, which in turn will be liable to the Gödel procedure for finding a"

"16484","   produce as being true, although a mind can see it is true. And so the machine will"
"16485","   still not be an adequate model of the mind. We are trying to produce a model of the"

"16581","complicated that we simply can't figure out how to apply it."
"16582","         Of course, this borderline of one's abilities will be somewhat ill-defined, just as is"

"16606","That is, there would be a program to produce new names in a regular way, and when it"

"16884","   detail which I had overlooked: the subunit which directed the disassembly and"
"16885","   reassembly processes was itself stable during the entire process. That is, for obvious"
"16886","   reasons, it could not take itself apart and rebuild itself, so it stayed intact."
"16887","Achilles: Yes, but what consequences did that have."
"16888","Crab: Oh, the direst ones! For you see, Mr. T focused his method down onto that subunit"
"16889","   entirely."
"16890","Achilles: How is that="
"16891","Crab: He simply made a record which would induce fatal vibrations in the one structure"
"16892","   he knew would never change-the disassembly reassembly subunit."
"16893","Achilles: Oh, I see ... Very sneaky."
"16894","Crab: Yes, so I thought, too. And his strategy worked. Not the first time, mind you. I"

"16908","Achilles: Upon my soul! You must have felt devastated."

"16926","Achilles: What is the Tobacco Mosaic Virus? What are ribosomes?"
"16927","Crab: I can't quite say, for I'm a total dunce when it comes to biology. All I know is what"

"16951","Achilles: Well, what does ""spontaneous self-assembly"" mean, then?"
"16952","Crab: The idea is that when some biological units inside a cell are taken apart, they can"
"16953","  spontaneously reassemble themselves-without being directed by any other unit. The"

"16962","Achilles: A hefty bill to fill."
"16963","Crab: True; but after several months, he wrote to me that he had succeeded, at long last-"

"17015","Crab: All right, then. My basic plan is to use a LABELING technique. To each and every"
"17016","  one of my records will be attached a secret label. Now the phonograph before you"
"17017","  contains, as did its predecessors, a television camera for scanning the records, and a"

"17020","Achilles: Ah, sweet revenge! But it seems to me that your plan will be easy to foil. All"
"17021","  Mr. T needs to do is to get a hold of one of your records, and copy its label!"
"17022","Crab: Not so simple, Achilles. What makes you think he will be able to tell the label from"
"17023","  the rest of the record? It may be better integrated than you suspect."
"17024","Achilles: Do you mean that it could be mixed up somehow with the actual music?"
"17025","Crab: Precisely. But there is a way to disentangle the two. It requires sucking the data off"

"17036","  records of pieces in my own style-and it will be hopelessly difficult for Mr. T to"

"17142","  the moment it appears on the screen around a hundredth of a second. So if you have a"
"17143","  nesting of depth fifty or so, roughly a half-second delay will result. If somehow a"
"17144","  moving image gets onto the screen-for example, by you putting your finger in front of"
"17145","  the camera-then it takes a while for the more deeply nested screens to ""find out"" about"

"17200","To begin with, let us look at sentences which, at first glance, may seem to provide the"
"17201","simplest examples of self-reference. Some such sentences are these:"
"17202","         (1) This sentence contains five words."
"17203","         (2) This sentence is meaningless because it is self-referential."
"17204","         (3) This sentence no verb."
"17205","         (4) This sentence is false. (Epimenides paradox)"

"17207","All but the last one (which is an anomaly) involve the simple-seeming mechanism contained"
"17208","in the phrase ""this sentence"". But that mechanism is in reality far from simple. All of these"
"17209","sentences are ""floating"" in the context of the English language. They can be compared to"
"17210","icebergs, whose tips only are visible. The word sequences are the tips of the icebergs, and the"
"17211","processing which must be done to understand them is the hidden part. In this sense their"
"17212","meaning is implicit, not explicit. Of course, no sentence's meaning is completely explicit, but"
"17213","the more explicit the self-reference is, the more exposed will be the mechanisms underlying"
"17214","it. In this case, for the self-reference of the sentences above to be recognized, not only has"
"17215","one to be comfortable with a language such as English which can deal with linguistic subject"

"17281","inside the Dialogue itself, so we need not dwell on such matters here. Let us instead show"

"17288","    PERIOD]."

"17291","       BRACKET, QUOTE-MARK, TEMPLATE, QUOTE-MARK, RIGHT-BRACKET,"
"17292","       PERIOD]. ENIUQ']."
"17293","ENIUQ is a procedure defined in the first two lines, and its input is called ""TEMPLATE"". It"
"17294","is understood that when the procedure is called, TEMPLATE's value will be some string of"
"17295","typographical characters. The effect of ENIUQ is to carry out a printing operation, in which"
"17296","TEMPLATE gets printed twice: the first time just plain; the second time wrapped in (single)"
"17297","quotes and brackets, and garnished with a final period. Thus, if TEMPLATE's value were"
"17298","the string DOUBLE-BUBBLE, then performing ENIUQ on it would yield:"
"17299","DOUBLE-BUBBLE ['DOUBLE-BUBBLE']."
"17300","Now in the last four lines of the program above, the procedure ENIUQ is called with a"
"17301","specific value of TEMPLATE-namely the long string inside the single quotes: DEFINE ..."
"17302","ENIUQ. That value has been carefully chosen; it consists of the definition of ENIUQ,"
"17303","followed by the word ENIUQ. This makes the program itself-or, if you prefer, a perfect copy"

"17305","                        ""yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation"""
"17306","                         yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation."

"17311","TEMPLATE-is never interpreted as a sequence of instructions. That it happens to be one is,"
"17312","in a sense. just an accident. As was pointed out above, it could just as well have been"
"17313","DOUBLE-BUBBLE or any other string of characters. The beauty of the scheme is that when"
"17314","the same string appears in the top two lines of this program, it is treated as a program"
"17315","(because it is not in quotes). Thus in this program, one string functions in two ways: first as"
"17316","program, and second as data. This is the secret of self-reproducing programs, and, as we shall"
"17317","see, of self-reproducing molecules. It is useful, incidentally, to call any kind of self-"
"17318","•reproducing object or entity a self-rep; and likewise to call any self-referring object or entity"
"17319","a self-ref. I will use those terms occasionally from here on."
"17320","         The preceding program is an elegant example of a self-reproducing program written"
"17321","in a language which was not designed to make the writing of self-reps particularly easy."
"17322","Thus, the task had to be carried out using those notions and operations which were assumed"
"17323","to be part of the language-such as the word QUOTE-MARK, and the command PRINT. But"
"17324","suppose a language were designed expressly for making self-reps easy to write. Then one"
"17325","could write much shorter self-reps. For example, suppose that the operation of eniuq-ing"
"17326","were a built-in feature of the language, needing no explicit definition (as we assumed PRINT"
"17327","was). Then a teeny self-rep would be this:"
"17328","                                       ENIUQ ['ENIUQ']."
"17329","It is very similar to the Tortoise's version of Quine's version of the Epimenides self-ref,"
"17330","where the verb ""to quine"" is assumed to be known:"
"17331","                   ""yields falsehood when quined"" yields falsehood when quined"
"17332","         But self-reps can be even shorter. For instance, in some computer language it might"
"17333","be a convention that any program whose first symbol is an asterisk is to be copied before"
"17334","being executed normally. Then the program consisting of merely one asterisk is a self-rep!"
"17335","You may complain that this is silly and depends on a totally arbitrary convention. In doing"
"17336","so, you are echoing my earlier point that it is almost cheating to use the phrase ""this"
"17337","sentence"" to achieve self-reference-it relies too much on the processor, and not enough on"
"17338","explicit directions for self-reference. Using an asterisk as an example of a self-rep is like"
"17339","using the word ""I"" as an example of a self-ref: both conceal all the interesting aspects of their"
"17340","respective problems."
"17341","         This is reminiscent of another curious type of self-reproduction: via photocopy"
"17342","machine. It might be claimed that any written document is a self-rep because it can cause a"
"17343","copy of itself to be printed when it is placed in a photocopy machine and the appropriate"
"17344","button is pushed. But somehow this violates our notion of self-reproduction; the piece of"
"17345","paper is not consulted at all, and is therefore not directing its own reproduction. Again,"
"17346","everything is in the processor. Before we call something a self-rep, we want to have the"

"17388","          However, this is a disquieting conclusion, because we are accustomed to considering"

"17416","The idea of printing out a translation instead of an exact copy of the original program may"
"17417","seem pointless. However, if you wanted to write a self-rep program in BlooP or FlooP, you"
"17418","would have to resort to some such device, for in those languages, OUTPUT is always a"
"17419","number, rather than a typographical string. Therefore, you would have to make the program"
"17420","print out its own Godel number: a very huge integer whose decimal expansion codes for the"
"17421","program, character by character, by using three digit codons. The program is coming as close"
"17422","as it can to printing itself, within the means available to it: it prints out a copy of itself in"
"17423","another ""space"", and it is easy to switch back and forth between the space of integers and the"
"17424","space of strings. Thus, the value of OUTPUT is not a mere trigger, like ""11-12"". Instead, all"

"17426","                                    Godelian Self-Reference"
"17427","This comes very close to describing the mechanism of Godel's self-ref G. After all, that string"
"17428","of TNT contains a description not of itself, but of an integer (the arithmoquinification of u). It"
"17429","just so happens that that integer is an exact ""image"" of the string G, in the space of natural"
"17430","numbers. Thus, G refers to a translation of itself into another space. We still feel comfortable"
"17431","in calling G a self-referential string, because the isomorphism between the two spaces is so"
"17432","tight that we can consider them to be identical."
"17433","         This isomorphism that mirrors TNT inside the abstract realm of natural numbers can"
"17434","be likened to the quasi-isomorphism that mirrors the real world inside our brains, by means"
"17435","of symbols. The symbols play quasi-isomorphic roles to the objects, and it is thanks to them"
"17436","that we can think. Likewise, the Godel numbers play isomorphic roles to strings, and it is"
"17437","thanks to them that we can find metamathematical meanings in statements about natural"
"17438","numbers. The amazing, nearly magical, thing about G is that it manages to achieve self-"

"17463","prints itself out precisely; yet all clearly belong to a single ""family""."
"17464","          This is reminiscent of the self-reproduction of living organisms. Clearly, an"

"17543","strands, in Typogenetics, play the role of pieces of DNA (which, in real genetics, are often"
"17544","called ""strands""). Not only this, but ""STRAND"" fully spelled out backwards is ""DNA RTS"","

"17549","         I will sometimes refer to the letters A, C, G, T as bases, and to the positions which"

"17552","         If you have a strand, you can operate on it and change it in various ways. You can"

"17555","         Operations come in packets-that is, several to be performed together, in order. Such a"

"17565","A, those which prefer C, etc. Given the sequence of operations which an enzyme performs,"
"17566","you can figure out which letter it prefers, but for now I'll just give them without explanation."
"17567","Here's a sample enzyme, consisting of three operations:"
"17568","    (1) Delete the unit to which the enzyme is bound (and then bind to the next unit to the"
"17569","    right)."
"17570","    (2) Move one unit to the right."
"17571","    (3) Insert a T (to the immediate right of this unit)."
"17572","This enzyme happens to like to bind to A initially. And here's a sample strand:"
"17573","                                                ACA"
"17574","What happens if our enzyme binds to the left A and begins acting? Step I deletes the A, so we"
"17575","are left with CA-and the enzyme is now bound to the C. Step 2 slides the enzyme rightwards,"
"17576","to the A, and Step 3 appends a T onto the end to form the strand CAT. And the enzyme has"
"17577","done its complete duty: it has transformed ACA into CAT."
"17578","         What if it had bound itself to the right A of ACA? It would have deleted that A and"
"17579","moved off the end of the strand. Whenever this happens, the enzyme quits (this is a general"
"17580","principle). So the entire effect would just be to lop off one symbol."
"17581","Let's see some more examples. Here is another enzyme:"
"17582","    (1) Search for the nearest pyrimidine to the right of this unit."
"17583","    (2) Go into Copy mode."
"17584","    (3) Search for the nearest purine to the right of this unit."
"17585","    (4) Cut the strand here (viz., to the right of the present unit)."

"17588","means searching for the nearest C or T."
"17589","                                Copy Mode and Double Strands"

"17591","funny way. Instead of copying A onto A, you copy it onto T, and vice versa. And instead of"

"17604","Let's see this in concrete terms. Let the previous enzyme act on the following strand (and that"

"17609","or a T. The first one is a T somewhere near the middle of the strand, so that's where we go."
"17610","Now step 2: Copy mode. Well, we just put an upside-down A above our T. But that's not all,"
"17611","for Copy mode remains in effect until it is shut off-or until the enzyme is done, whichever"
"17612","comes first. This means that every base which is passed through by the enzyme while Copy"
"17613","mode is on will get a complementary base put above it. Step 3 says to look for a purine to the"
"17614","right of our T. That is the G two symbols in from the right-hand end. Now as we move up to"
"17615","that G, we must ""copy""-that is, create a complementary strand. Here's what that gives:"
"17616","(editor’ s note, I can’t print upside down ie it is too much hard work so V = A and D = G"

"17800","enzymes (via the Typogenetic Code); and how in turn, enzymes act back on the strands"
"17801","which gave rise to them, yielding new strands. Therefore, the line on the left portrays how"

"17803","contains therefore the same information as the strand, only in a different form-in particular;"
"17804","in an active form. The line on the right, however, does not show information flowing"
"17805","downwards; instead, it shows how new information gets created: by the shunting of symbols"

"17807","         An enzyme in Typogenetics, like a rule of inference in a formal system, blindly"

"17838","a phosphate group stripped of one special oxygen atom, whence the prefix ""deoxy""; (2) a"
"17839","sugar called ""ribose"", and (3) a base. It is the base alone which distinguishes one nucleotide"
"17840","from another; thus it suffices to specify its base to identify a nucleotide. The four types of"
"17841","bases which occur in DNA nucleotides are:"
"17842","(Also see Fig. 91.) It is easy to remember which ones are pyrimidines because the first vowel"
"17843","in ""cytosine"", ""thymine"", and ""pyrimidine"" is 'y'. Later, when we talk about RNA, ""uracil""-"

"18154","We have been using this image of ribosome as tape recorder, mRNA as tape, and protein as"
"18155","music. It may seem arbitrary, and yet there are some beautiful parallels. Music is not a mere"
"18156","linear sequence of notes. Our minds perceive pieces of music on a level far higher than that."
"18157","We chunk notes into phrases, phrases into melodies, melodies into movements, and"
"18158","movements into full pieces. Similarly, proteins only make sense when they act as chunked"
"18159","units. Although a primary structure carries all the information for the tertiary structure to be"
"18160","created, it still ""feels"" like less, for its potential is only realized when the tertiary structure is"
"18161","actually physically created."
"18162","  Incidentally, we have been referring only to primary and tertiary structures, and you may"
"18163","well wonder whatever happened to the secondary structure. Indeed, it exists, as does a"
"18164","quaternary structure, as well. The folding-up of a protein occurs at more than one level."
"18165","Specifically, at some points along the chain of amino acids, there may be a tendency to form"
"18166","a kind of helix, called the alpha helix (not to be confused with the DNA double helix). This"
"18167","helical twisting of a protein is on a lower level than its tertiary structure. This level of"
"18168","structure is visible in Figure 95. Quaternary structure can be directly compared with the"
"18169","building of 'a musical piece out of independent movements, for it involves the assembly of'"
"18170","several distinct polypeptides, already in their full-blown tertiary beauty, into a larger"
"18171","structure. The binding of these independent chains is usually accomplished by hydrogen"
"18172","bonds, rather than covalent bonds; this is of course just as with pieces of music composed of"
"18173","several movements, which are far less tightly bound to each other than they are internally, but"
"18174","which nevertheless form a tight ""organic"" whole."

"18185","Now we come to another lovely parallel between tape recorders translating tape into music"
"18186","and ribosomes translating mRNA into proteins. Imagine a collection of many tape recorders,"
"18187","arranged in a row, evenly spaced. We might call this array a ""polyrecorder"". Now imagine a"
"18188","single tape passing serially through the playing heads of all the component recorders. If the"

"18192","long lines-forming what is called a polyribosome-all ""play"" the same strand of mRNA,"
"18193","producing identical proteins, staggered in time (see Fig. 97)."
"18194","        Not only this, but nature goes one better. Recall that mRNA is made by transcription"
"18195","off of DNA; the enzymes which are responsible for this process are called RNA polymerases"
"18196","(""-ase"" is a general suffix for enzymes). It happens often that a series of RNA polymerases"

"18261","essentially only a single task, rather than a sequence of tasks. There is one other striking"

"18291","It is not by any means coincidental that the phrases ""sufficiently strong support system"" and"
"18292","""sufficiently powerful formal system"" sound alike. One is the precondition for a self-rep to"
"18293","arise, the other for a self-ref to arise. In fact there is in essence only one phenomenon going"
"18294","on in two very different guises, and we shall explicitly map this out shortly. But before we do"
"18295","so, let us finish the description of how a strand of DNA can be a self-rep."
"18296","         The DNA must contain the codes for a set of proteins which will copy it. Now there"
"18297","is a very efficient and elegant way to copy a double-stranded piece of DNA, whose two"
"18298","strands are complementary. This involves two steps:"
"18299","       (1) unravel the two strands from each other;"
"18300","       (2) mate"" a new strand to each of the two new single strands."
"18301","This process will create two new double strands of DNA, each identical to the original one."
"18302","Now if our solution is to be based on this idea, it must involve a set of proteins, coded for in"
"18303","the DNA itself, which will carry out these two steps."
"18304","         It is believed that in cells, these two steps are performed together in a coordinated"
"18305","way, and that they require three principal enzymes: DNA endonuclease, DNA polymerase,"
"18306","and DNA ligase. The first is an ""unzipping enzyme"": it peels the two original strands apart"
"18307","for a short distance, and then stops. Then the other two enzymes come into the picture. The"
"18308","DNA polymerase is basically a copy-and-move enzyme: it chugs down the short single"
"18309","strands of DNA, copying them complementarily in a fashion reminiscent of the Copy mode"
"18310","in Typogenetics. In order to copy, it draws on raw materials-specifically nucleotides-which"
"18311","are floating about in the cytoplasm. Because the action proceeds in fits and starts, with some"
"18312","unzipping and some copying each time, some short gaps are created, and the DNA ligase is"
"18313","what plugs them up. The process is repeated over and over again. This precision three-"
"18314","enzyme machine proceeds in careful fashion all the way down the length of the DNA"
"18315","molecule, until the whole thing has been peeled apart and simultaneously replicated, so that"

"18319","                     Comparison of DNA's Self-Rep Method with Quining"
"18320","Note that in the enzymatic action on the DNA strands, the fact that information is stored in"
"18321","the DNA is just plain irrelevant; the enzymes are merely carrying out their symbol-shunting"
"18322","functions, just like rules of inference in the MMIU-system. It is of no interest to the three"
"18323","enzymes that at some point they are actually copying the very genes which coded for them."
"18324","The DNA, to them, is just a template without meaning or interest."
"18325","         It is quite interesting to compare this with the Quine sentence's method of describing"
"18326","how to construct a copy of itself. There, too, one has a sort of ""double strand""-two copies of"
"18327","the same information, where one copy acts as instructions, the other as template. In DNA, the"
"18328","process is vaguely parallel, since the three enzymes (DNA endonuclease, DNA polymerase,"
"18329","DNA ligase) are coded for in just one of the two strands, which therefore acts as program,"
"18330","while the other strand is merely a template. The parallel is not perfect, for when the copying"
"18331","is carried out, both strands are used as template, not just one. Nevertheless, the analogy is"
"18332","highly suggestive. There is a biochemical analogue to the use-mention dichotomy: when"
"18333","DNA is treated as a mere sequence of chemicals to be copied, it is like mention of"

"18335","use of typographical symbols."

"18337","There are several levels of meaning which can be read from a strand of DNA, depending on"
"18338","how big the chunks are which you look at, and how powerful a decoder you use. On the"
"18339","lowest level, each DNA strand codes for an equivalent RNA strand-the process of decoding"
"18340","being transcription. If one chunks the DNA into triplets, then by using a ""genetic decoder"","
"18341","one can read the DNA as a sequence of amino acids. This is translation (on top of"
"18342","transcription). On the next natural level of the hierarchy, DNA is readable as a code for a set"
"18343","of proteins. The physical pulling-out of proteins from genes is called gene expression."
"18344","Currently, this is the highest level at which we understand what DNA means."
"18345","         However, there are certain to be higher levels of DNA meaning which are harder to"
"18346","discern. For instance, there is every reason to believe that the DNA of, say, a human being"
"18347","codes for such features as nose shape, music talent, quickness of reflexes, and so on. Could"
"18348","one, in principle, learn to read off such pieces of information directly from a strand of DNA,"
"18349","without going through the actual physical process of epigenesis-the physical pulling-out of"
"18350","phenotype from genotype Presumably, yes, since-in theory-one could have an incredibly"
"18351","powerful computer program simulating the entire process, including every cell, every protein,"
"18352","every tiny feature involved in the replication of DNA, of cells, to the bitter end. The output of"

"18564"," (By the way, can you spot how this sentence differs from -G?) The reason I show it"

"18567","justified. Do Henkin sentences indeed possess derivations? Are they, as they claim,"

"18569","he may be honest, and yet he may not be. Are Henkin sentences any more trustworthy than"
"18570","politicians? Or do Henkin sentences, like politicians, lie in cast-iron sinks?"
"18571","         It turns out that these Henkin sentences are invariably truth tellers. Why this is so is"

"18573","                             Implicit vs. Explicit Henkin Sentences"
"18574","I mentioned that a Henkin sentence tells nothing about its own derivation; it just asserts that"
"18575","one exists. Now it is possible to invent a variation on the theme of Henkin sentences-namely"
"18576","sentences which explicitly describe their own derivations. Such a sentence's high-level"
"18577","interpretation would not be ""Some Sequence of Strings Exists Which is a Derivation of Me"","
"18578","but rather, ""The Herein-described Sequence of Strings            Is a Derivation of Me"". Let us"
"18579","call the first type of sentence an implicit Henkin sentence. The new sentences will be called"
"18580","explicit Henkin sentences, since they explicitly describe their own derivations. Note that,"
"18581","unlike their implicit brethren, explicit Henkin sentences need not be theorems. In fact, it is"
"18582","quite easy to write a string which asserts that its own derivation consists of the single string"
"18583","0=0-a false statement, since 0=0 is not a derivation of anything. However, it is also possible"
"18584","to write an explicit Henkin sentence which is a theorem-that is, a sentence which in fact gives"
"18585","a recipe for its own derivation."
"18586","                              Henkin Sentences and Self-Assembly"
"18587","The reason I bring up this distinction between explicit and implicit Henkin sentences is that it"
"18588","corresponds very nicely to a significant distinction between types of virus. There are certain"
"18589","viruses, such as the so-called ""tobacco mosaic virus"", which are called self-assembling"
"18590","viruses; and then there are others, such as our favorite T-evens, which are non-self-"
"18591","assembling. Now what is this distinction? It is a direct analogue to the distinction between"
"18592","implicit and explicit Henkin sentences."
"18593","         The DNA of a self-assembling virus codes only for the parts of a new virus, but not"
"18594","for any enzymes. Once the parts are produced, the sneaky virus relies upon them to link up to"
"18595","each other without help from any enzymes. Such a process depends on chemical affinities"
"18596","which the parts have for each other, when swimming in the rich chemical brew of a cell. Not"

"18599",""
"18600","themselves. Somtiems enzymes may be needed – but in such cases, they are recruited from"
"18601","the host cell, and enslaved. This is what is meant by self-assembly."
"18602","         By contrast, the DNA of more complex viruses, such as the T-evens, codes not only"
"18603","for the parts, but in addition for various enzymes which play special roles in the assembly of"
"18604","the parts into wholes. Since the assembly process is not spontaneous but requires ""machines"","
"18605","such viruses are not considered to be self-assembling. The essence of the distinction, then,"
"18606","between self-assembling units and non-self-assembling units is that the former get away with"
"18607","self-reproduction without telling the cell anything about their construction, while the latter"
"18608","need to give instructions as to how to assemble themselves."
"18609","         Now the parallel to Henkin sentences, implicit and explicit, ought to be quite clear."
"18610","Implicit Henkin sentences are self-proving but do not tell anything at all about their proofs-"
"18611","they are analogous to self-assembling viruses; explicit Henkin sentences direct the"
"18612","construction of their own proofs-they are analogous to more complex viruses which direct"
"18613","their host cells in putting copies of themselves together."
"18614","         The concept of self-assembling biological structures as complex as viruses raises the"
"18615","possibility of complex self-assembling machines as well. Imagine a set of parts which, when"
"18616","placed in the proper supporting environment, spontaneously group themselves in such a way"
"18617","as to form a complex machine. It seems unlikely, yet this is quite an accurate way to describe"
"18618","the process of the tobacco mosaic virus' method of selfreproduction via self-assembly. The"
"18619","information for the total conformation of the organism (or machine) is spread about in its"
"18620","parts; it is not concentrated in some single place."
"18621","         Now this concept can lead in some strange directions, as was shown in the Edifying"
"18622","Thoughts of a Tobacco Smoker. There, we saw how the Crab used the idea that information"

"18650","                                   Feedback and Feedforward"
"18651","Feedback takes place when there is too much or too little of some desired substance in the"
"18652","cell: then the cell must somehow regulate the production line which is assembling that"
"18653","substance. Feedforward also involves the regulation of"" an assembly line, but not according"
"18654","to the amount of end product present: rather, according to the amount of some precursor of"
"18655","the end product of that assembly line. There are two major devices for achieving negative"
"18656","feedforward or feedback. One way is to prevent the relevant enzymes from being able to"
"18657","perform-that is, to ""clog up"" their active sites. This is called inhibition. The other way is to"
"18658","prevent the relevant enzymes from ever being manufactured! This is called repression."
"18659","Conceptually, inhibition is simple: you just block up the active site of the first enzyme in the"
"18660","assembly line, and the whole process of synthesis gets stopped dead."
"18661","                                     Repressors and Inducers"
"18662","Repression is trickier. How does a cell stop a gene from being expressed? The answer is, it"
"18663","prevents it from ever getting transcribed. This means that it has to prevent RNA polymerase"
"18664","from doing its job. This can be accomplished by placing a huge obstacle in its path, along the"
"18665","DNA. precisely in front of that gene which the cell wants not to get transcribed. Such"
"18666","obstacles do exist, and are called repressors. They are themselves proteins, and they bind to"
"18667","special obstacle-holding sites on the DNA, called (I am not sure why) operators. An operator"
"18668","therefore is a site of control for the gene (or genes) which immediately follow it: those genes"
"18669","are called its operon. Because a series of enzymes often act in concert in carrying out a long"
"18670","chemical transformation, they are often coded for in sequence; and this is why operons often"
"18671","contain several genes, rather than just one. The effect of the successful repression of an"

"18678","unclog the clogged enzymes, or (2) stop the repression of the relevant operon. (Notice how"
"18679","nature seems to love double-negations! Probably there is some very deep reason for this.)"
"18680","The mechanism by which repression is repressed involves a class of molecules called"

"19159","which, on a low level, is governed by simple, even formal, rules. The ""system"", of course,"
"19160","is a brain-unless one is' speaking of thought processes flowing in another medium, such"
"19161","as a computer's circuits. The image is that of a formal system underlying an ""informal"
"19162","system""-a system which can, for instance, make puns, discover number patterns, forget"
"19163","names, make awful blunders in chess, and so forth. This is what one sees from the"
"19164","outside: its informal, overt, software level. By contrast, it has a formal, hidden, hardware"
"19165","level (or ""substrate"") which is a formidably complex mechanism that makes transitions"
"19166","from state to state according to definite rules physically embodied in it, and according to"
"19167","the input of signals which impinge on it."
"19168","        A vision of the brain such as this has many philosophical and other consequences,"
"19169","needless to say. I shall try to spell some of them out in this Chapter. Among other things,"
"19170","this vision seems to imply that, at bottom, the brain is some sort of a ""mathematical"""
"19171","object. Actually, that is at best a very awkward way to look at the brain. The reason is"
"19172","that, even if a brain is, in a technical and abstract sense, some sort of formal system, it"
"19173","remains true that mathematicians only work with simple and elegant systems, systems in"
"19174","which everything is extremely clearly defined-and the brain is a far cry from that, with its"
"19175","ten billion or more semi-independent neurons, quasi-randomly connected up to each"

"19319","sponsored by Hardy; and then followed an intense collaboration which terminated in"
"19320","Ramanujan's early demise at age thin thirty-three from tuberculosis."
"19321","         Ramanujan had several extraordinary characteristics which set him apart from the"
"19322","majority of mathematicians. One was his lack of rigor. Very often he would simply state"
"19323","a result which, he would insist, had just come to"
"19324","Church, Turing, Tarski, and Others                                                     558"

"19327","often said that the goddess Namagiri inspired him in his dreams. This happened time and"
"19328","again, and what made it all the more mystifying-perhaps even imbuing it with a certain"
"19329","mystical quality-was the fact that many of his ""intuition-theorems"" were wrong. Now"
"19330","there is a curious paradoxical effect where sometimes an event which you think could not"

"19336","Truth, and the fact of his fallibility seemed, if anything, to strengthen, rather than"

"19338","         Of course it didn't hurt that he was from one of the most backward parts of India,"
"19339","where fakirism and other eerie Indian rites had been practiced for millennia, and were"

"19342","that he was merely human, paradoxically inspired the idea that Ramanujan's wrongness"
"19343","always had some sort of ""deeper rightness"" to it-an ""Oriental"" rightness, perhaps touching"
"19344","upon truths inaccessible to Western minds. What a delicious, almost irresistible thought!"
"19345","Even Hardy-who would have been the first to deny that Ramanujan had any mystical"

"19354","     taxi-cab No. 1729, and remarked that the number seemed to me rather a dull one,"
"19355","     and that I hoped it was not an unfavorable omen. ""No,"" he replied, ""it is a very"

"19358","     corresponding problem for fourth powers; and he replied, after a moment's"
"19359","     thought, that he could see no obvious example, and thought that the first such"
"19360","     number must be very large.'"
"19361","It turns out that the answer for fourth powers is:"
"19362","                             635318657 = 134 + 1334 = 1584 + 594"

"19388","   was sitting near the table, turning over the pages of the Magazine. I got interested in"
"19389","   a problem involving a relation between two numbers. I have forgotten the details;"
"19390","   but I remember the type of the problem. Two British officers had been billeted in"
"19391","   Paris in two different houses in a long street; the door numbers of these houses"
"19392","   were related in a special way; the problem was to find out the two numbers. It was"
"19393","   not at all difficult. I got the solution in a few minutes by trial and error."
"19394","   MAHALANOBIS (in a joking way): Now here is a problem for you."
"19395","   RAMANUJAN: What problem, tell me.'(He went on stirring the pan.) I read out the"
"19396","   question from the ""Strand Magazine""."
"19397","   RAMANUJAN: Please take down the solution. (He dictated a continued fraction.)"
"19398","        The first term was the solution which I had obtained. Each successive term"
"19399","   represented successive solutions for the same type of relation between two numbers,"
"19400","   as the number of houses in the street would increase indefinitely. I was amazed."
"19401","   MAHALANOBIS: Did you get the solution in a flash?"
"19402","   RAMANUJAN: Immediately I heard the problem, it was clear that the Solution was"
"19403","   obviously a continued fraction; I then thought, ""Which continued fraction?"" and the"

"19405","Hardy, as Ramanujan's closest co-worker, was often asked after"

"19410","   I have often been asked whether Ramanujan had any special secret; whether his"
"19411","   methods differed in kind from those of other mathematicians; whether there was"
"19412","   anything really abnormal in his mode of thought. I cannot answer these questions"
"19413","   with any confidence or conviction; but I do not believe it. My belief is that all"
"19414","   mathematicians think, at bottom, in the same kind of way, and that Ramanujan was"
"19415","   no exception .5"
"19416","Here Hardy states in essence his own version of the Church-Turing Thesis. I paraphrase:"
"19417","CHURCH-TURING THESIS, HARDY'S VERSION: At bottom, all mathematicians are"
"19418","isomorphic."
"19419","This does not equate the mathematical potential of mathematicians with that of general"
"19420","recursive functions; for that, however, all you need is to show that some mathematician's"
"19421","mental capacity is no more general than recursive functions. Then, if you believe Hardy's"
"19422","Version, you know it for all mathematicians."
"19423","Then Hardy compares Ramanujan with calculating prodigies:"
"19424","   His memory, and his powers of calculation, were very unusual, but they could not"
"19425","   reasonably be called ""abnormal"". If he had to multiply two large numbers, he"
"19426","   multiplied them in the ordinary way; he could do it with unusual rapidity and"
"19427","   accuracy, but not more rapidly and accurately than any mathematician who is"
"19428","   naturally quick and has the habit of computations"
"19429","Hardy describes what he perceived as Ramanujan's outstanding intellectual attributes:"
"19430","   With his memory, his patience, and his power of calculation, he combined a power"
"19431","   of generalisation, a feeling for form, and a capacity for rapid modification of his"
"19432","   hypotheses, that were often really startling, and made him, in his own field, without a"
"19433","   rival in his day.'"
"19434","The part of this passage which I have italicized seems to me to be an excellent"
"19435","characterization of some of the subtlest features of intelligence in general. Finally, Hardy"
"19436","concludes somewhat nostalgically:"
"19437","   [His work has not the simplicity and inevitableness of the very greatest work; it"
"19438","   would be greater if it were less strange. One gift it has which no one can deny-"
"19439","   profound and invincible originality. He would probably have been a greater"
"19440","   mathematician if he had been caught and tamed a little in his youth; he would have"
"19441","   discovered more that was new, and that, no doubt, of greater importance. On the"
"19442","   other hand he would have been less of a Ramanujan, and more of a European"
"19443","   professor and the loss might have been greater than the gain.8"

"19458","        I shall not describe the many fascinating documented cases of ""lightning"

"19471","        Incidentally, one of the most obvious clues that no ""hot line to God"" is involved is"
"19472","the mere fact that when the numbers involved get bigger, the answers are slower in"
"19473","coming. Presumably, if God or an ""oracle"" were supplying the answers, he wouldn't have"

"19478","           The Isomorphism Version of the Church-Turing Thesis"
"19479","This finally brings us to a strengthened standard version of the Church-Turing Thesis:"
"19480","   CHURCH-TURING THESIS, ISOMORPHISM VERSION: Suppose there is a"
"19481","      method which a sentient being follows in order to sort numbers into two classes."
"19482","      Suppose further that this method always yields an answer within a finite amount"
"19483","      of time, and that it always gives the same answer for a given number. Then:"
"19484","      Some terminating FlooP program (i.e.,"
"19485","Church, Turing, Tarski, and Others                                                          563"
"19486",""
"19487","      general recursive function) exists which gives exactly the same answers as the"
"19488","      sentient being's method does. Moreover: The mental process and the FlooP"
"19489","      program are isomorphic in the sense that on some level there is a correspondence"
"19490","      between the steps being carried out in both computer and brain."
"19491","Notice that not only has the conclusion been strengthened, but also the proviso of"
"19492","communicability of the faint-hearted Public-Processes Version has been dropped. This"
"19493","bold version is the one which we now shall discuss."
"19494","        In brief, this version asserts that when one computes something, one's mental"
"19495","activity can be mirrored isomorphically in some FlooP program. And let it be very clear"
"19496","that this does not mean that the brain is actually running a FlooP program, written in the"
"19497","FlooP language complete with BEGIN's, END's, ABORT's, and the rest-not at all. It is"
"19498","just that the steps are taken in the same order as they could be in a FlooP program, and"
"19499","the logical structure of the calculation can be mirrored in a FlooP program."
"19500","        Now in order to make sense of this idea, we shall have to make some level"
"19501","distinctions in both computer and brain, for otherwise it could be misinterpreted as utter"
"19502","nonsense. Presumably the steps of the calculation going on inside a person's head are on"
"19503","the highest level, and are supported by lower levels, and eventually by hardware. So if we"
"19504","speak of an isomorphism, it means we've tacitly made the assumption that the highest"
"19505","level can be isolated, allowing us to discuss what goes on there independently of other"
"19506","levels, and then to map that top level into FlooP. To be more precise, the assumption is"
"19507","that there exist software entities which play the roles of various mathematical constructs,"
"19508","and which are activated in ways which can be mirrored exactly inside FlooP (see Fig."
"19509","106). What enables these software entities to come into existence is the entire"
"19510","infrastructure discussed in Chapters XI and XI I, as well as in the Prelude, Ant Fugue."
"19511","There is no assertion of isomorphic activity on the lower levels of brain and computer"
"19512","(e.g., neurons and bits)."
"19513","        The spirit of the Isomorphism Version, if not the letter, is gotten across by saying"
"19514","that what an idiot savant does in calculating, say, the logarithm of 7r, is isomorphic to"
"19515","what a pocket calculator does in calculating it-where the isomorphism holds on the"
"19516","arithmetic-step level, not on the lower levels of, in the one case, neurons, and in the other,"
"19517","integrated circuits. (Of course different routes can be followed in calculating anything-but"

"19968",""
"19969","some sort of inner meaning inside the picture, a multidimensional aspect trapped"
"19970","somehow inside those two dimensions. It is the word ""meaning"" which is important here."
"19971","Our minds contain interpreters which accept"
"19972","two-dimensional patterns and then ""pull"" from them high-dimensional notions which are"
"19973","so complex that we cannot consciously describe them. The same can be said about how"
"19974","we respond to music, incidentally."
"19975","        It feels subjectively that the pulling-out mechanism of inner meaning is not at all"
"19976","akin to a decision procedure which checks for the presence or absence of some particular"
"19977","quality such as well-formedness in a string. Probably this is because inner meaning is"
"19978","something which reveals more of itself over a period of time. One can never be sure, as"
"19979","one can about well-formedness, that one has finished with the issue."
"19980","        This suggests a distinction that could be drawn between two senses of ""form"" in"
"19981","patterns which we analyze. First, there are qualities such as well-formedness, which can"
"19982","be detected by predictably terminating tests, as in BlooP programs. These I propose to"
"19983","call syntactic qualities of form. One intuitively feels about the syntactic aspects of form"
"19984","that they lie close to the surface, and therefore they do not provoke the creation of"
"19985","multidimensional cognitive structures."
"19986","        By contrast, the semantic aspects of form are those which cannot be tested for in"
"19987","predictable lengths of time: they require open-ended tests. Such an aspect is theoremhood"
"19988","of TNT-strings, as we have seen. You cannot just apply some standard test to a string and"
"19989","find out if it is a theorem. Somehow, the fact that its meaning is involved is crucially"
"19990","related to the difficulty of telling whether or not a string is a TNT-theorem. The act of"
"19991","pulling out a string's meaning involves, in essence, establishing all the implications of its"

"19993","""semantic"" properties are connected to open-ended searches because, in an important"

"19995","no understanding of any object's meaning is possible until the end of time, for as time"
"19996","passes, more and more of the meaning unfolds. However, there are always aspects of its"
"19997","meaning which will remain hidden arbitrarily long."
"19998","               Meaning Derives from Connections to Cognitive Structures"
"19999","        Let us switch from strings to pieces of music, just for variety. You may still"
"20000","        substitute the term ""string"" for every reference to a piece of music, if you prefer."
"20001","        The discussion is meant to be general, but its flavor is better gotten across, I feel,"
"20002","        by referring to music. There is a strange duality about the meaning of a piece of"
"20003","        music: on the one hand, it seems to be spread around, by virtue of its relation to"
"20004","        many other things in the world-and yet, on the other hand, the meaning of a piece"
"20005","        of music is obviously derived from the music itself, so it must be localized"
"20006","        somewhere inside the music."
"20007","        The resolution of this dilemma comes from thinking about the interpreter-the"

"20011","preter in this context, I mean not -the performer of the piece, but the mental mechanism"
"20012","in the listener which derives meaning when the piece is played.) The interpreter may"
"20013","discover many important aspects of a piece's meaning while hearing it for the first time;"
"20014","this seems to confirm the notion that the meaning is housed in the piece itself, and is"
"20015","simply being read off. But that is only part of the story. The music interpreter works by"
"20016","setting up a multidimensional cognitive structure-a mental representation of *_he piece-"
"20017","which it tries to integrate with pre-existent information by finding links to other"
"20018","multidimensional mental structures which encode previous experiences. As this process"
"20019","takes place, the full meaning gradually unfolds. In fact, years may pass before someone"
"20020","comes to feel that he has penetrated to the core meaning of a piece. This seems to support"
"20021","the opposite view: that musical meaning is spread around, the interpreter's role being to"
"20022","assemble it gradually."
"20023","         The truth undoubtedly lies somewhere in between: meanings-both musical and"
"20024","linguistic-are to some extent localizable, to some extent spread around. In the"
"20025","terminology of Chapter VI, we can say that musical pieces and pieces of text are partly"
"20026","triggers, and partly carriers of explicit meaning. A vivid illustration of this dualism of"
"20027","meaning is provided by the example of a tablet with an ancient inscription: the meaning"
"20028","is partially stored in the libraries and the brains of scholars around the world, and yet it is"
"20029","also obviously implicit in the tablet itself."
"20030","         Thus, another way of characterizing the difference between ""syntactic"" and"
"20031","""semantic"" properties (in the just-proposed sense) is that the syntactic ones reside"
"20032","unambiguously inside the object under consideration, whereas semantic properties"
"20033","depend on its relations with a potentially infinite class of other objects, and therefore are"
"20034","not completely localizable. There is nothing cryptic or hidden, in principle, in syntactic"

"20039","Is it even a semantic property? Is beauty a property which, for instance, a particular"

"20055","                The Neural Substrate of the Epimenides Paradox"
"20056","I would like to conclude this Chapter with some ideas about that central problem of truth,"
"20057","the Epimenides paradox. I think the Tarski reproduction of the Epimenides paradox"
"20058","inside TNT points the way to a deeper understanding of the nature of the Epimenides"
"20059","paradox in English. What Tarski found was that his version of the paradox has two"
"20060","distinct levels to it. On one level, it is a sentence about itself which would be true if it"
"20061","were false, and false if it were true. On the other level-which I like to call the arithmetical"
"20062","substrate-it is a sentence about integers which is true if and only if false."
"20063","        Now for some reason this latter bothers people a lot more than the former. Some"
"20064","people simply shrug off the former as ""meaningless"", because of its self-referentiality."
"20065","But you can't shrug off paradoxical statements about integers. Statements about integers"
"20066","simply cannot be both true and false."
"20067","        Now my feeling is that the Tarski transformation of the Epimenides paradox"
"20068","teaches us to look for a substrate in the English-language version. In the arithmetical"
"20069","version, the upper level of meaning is supported by the lower arithmetical level. Perhaps"
"20070","analogously, the self-referential sentence which we perceive (""This sentence is false"") is"
"20071","only the top level of a dual-level entity. What would be the lower level, then? Well, what"
"20072","is the mechanism that language rides on? The brain. Therefore one ought to look for a"
"20073","neural substrate to the Epimenides paradox-a lower level of physical events which clash"
"20074","with each other. That is, two events which by their nature cannot occur simultaneously. If"
"20075","this physical substrate exists, then the reason we cannot make heads or tails of the"
"20076","Epimenides sentence is that our brains are trying to do an impossible task."
"20077","        Now what would be the nature of the conflicting physical events? Presumably"
"20078","when you hear the Epimenides sentence, your brain sets up some ""coding"" of the"
"20079","sentence-an internal configuration of interacting symbols. Then it tries to classify the"

"20418","                                      The Turing Test"
"20419","Turing's article begins with the sentence: ""I propose to consider the question `Can"
"20420","machines think?""' Since, as he points out, these are loaded terms, it is obvious that we"
"20421","should search for an operational way to approach the question. This, he suggests, is"
"20422","contained in what he calls the ""imitation game""; it is nowadays known as the Turing test."
"20423","Turing introduces it as follows:"
"20424","    It is played with three people: a man (A), a woman (B), and an interrogator (C)"
"20425","    who may be of either sex. The interrogator stays in a room apart from the other"
"20426","    two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other"
"20427","    two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by labels X and Y, and at"
"20428","    the end of the game he says either ""X is A and Y is B"" or ""X is B and Y is A"". The"
"20429","    interrogator is allowed to put questions to A and B thus:"
"20430","    C: Will X please tell me the length of his or her hair?"
"20431","    Now suppose X is actually A, then A must answer. It is A's object in the game to"
"20432","    try to cause C to make the wrong identification. His answer might therefore be"
"20433","    ""My hair is shingled, and the longest strands are about nine inches long."""
"20434","    In order that tones of voice may not help the interrogator the answers should be"
"20435","    written, or better still, typewritten. The ideal arrangement is to have a teleprinter"
"20436","    communicating between the two rooms. Alternatively the questions and answers"
"20437","    can be repeated by an intermediary. The object of the game for the third player (B)"
"20438","    is to help the interrogator. The best strategy for her is probably to give truthful"
"20439","    answers. She can add such things as ""I am the woman, don't listen to him!"" to her"
"20440","    answers, but it will avail nothing as the man can make similar remarks."
"20441","Artificial Intelligence: Retrospects                                                     591"

"20443","    We now ask the question, ""What will happen when a machine takes the part of A"
"20444","    in this game Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is"

"20451","        Firth of Forth, in Scotland]."
"20452","        A. Count me out on this one. I never could write poetry."
"20453","        Q. Add 34957 to 70764."
"20454","        A. (Pause about 30 seconds and then give as answer) 105621."
"20455","        Q. Do you play chess?"
"20456","        A. Yes."
"20457","        Q. I have K at my K1, and no other pieces. You have only K at K6 and R at R1. It"
"20458","        is your move. What do you play?"
"20459","        A. (After a pause of 15 seconds) R-R8 mate."
"20460","Few readers notice that in the arithmetic problem, not only is there an inordinately long"
"20461","delay, but moreover, the answer given is wrong! This would be easy to account for if the"
"20462","respondent were a human: a mere calculational error. But if the respondent were a"
"20463","machine, a variety of explanations are possible. Here are some:"
"20464","        (1) a run-time error on the hardware level (i.e., an irreproducible fluke);"
"20465","        (2) an unintentional hardware (or programming) (reproducibly) causes"
"20466","        arithmetical mistakes;"
"20467","        (3) a ploy deliberately inserted by the machine's programmer (or builder) to"
"20468","        introduce occasional arithmetical mistakes, so as to trick interrogators;"
"20469","        (4) an unanticipated epiphenomenon: the program has a hard time thinking"
"20470","        abstractly, and simply made ""an honest mistake"", which it might not make the"
"20471","        next time around;"
"20472","        (5) a joke on the part of the machine itself, deliberately teasing its interrogator."
"20473","Reflection on what Turing might have meant by this subtle touch opens up just about all"
"20474","the major philosophical issues connected with Artificial Intelligence."
"20475","        Turing goes on to point out that"

"20490","   would clearly make a very poor showing. He would be given away at once by"
"20491","   slowness and inaccuracy in arithmetic. May not machines carry out something"
"20492","   which ought to be described as thinking but which is very different from what a"

"20494","   nevertheless, a machine can be constructed to play the imitation game satisfactorily,"
"20495","   we need not be troubled by this objection."
"20496","            It might be urged that when playing the ""imitation game"" the best strategy"
"20497","   for the machine may possibly be something other than imitation of the behaviour of"
"20498","   a man. This may be, but I think it is unlikely that there is any greet effect of this"

"20502","Once the test has been proposed and discussed, Turing remarks:"

"20792","  should instead merely look at what is on the board at present, and, using some"
"20793","  heuristics, generate a plan, and then find a move which advances that particular"

"20795","  heuristics which are, in some sense, ""flattened"" versions of looking ahead. That is,"

"20797","  another form which ostensibly doesn't involve looking ahead. In some sense this is"
"20798","  a game of words. But if the ""flattened"" knowledge gives answers more efficiently"
"20799","  than the actual look-ahead-even if it occasionally misleads- then something has"
"20800","  been gained. Now this kind of distillation of knowledge into more highly usable"
"20801","  forms is just what intelligence excels at-so look-ahead-less chess is probably a"
"20802","  fruitful line of research to push. Particularly intriguing would be to devise a"

"20805","                              Samuel's Checker Program"
"20806","  As a matter of fact, such a method was developed by Arthur Samuel in his"
"20807","  admirable checker-playing program. Samuel's trick was to use both dynamic (look-"
"20808","  ahead) and static (no-look-ahead) ways of evaluating any given board position. The"
"20809","  static method involved a simple mathematical function of several quantities"
"20810","  characterizing any board position, and thus could be calculated practically"
"20811","  instantaneously, whereas the dynamic evaluation method involved creating a ""tree"""
"20812","  of possible future moves, responses to them, responses to the responses, and so"
"20813","  forth (as was shown in Fig. 38). In the static evaluation function there were some"
"20814","  parameters which could vary; the effect of varying them was to provide a set of"
"20815","  different possible versions of the static evaluation function. Samuel's strategy was"
"20816","  to select, in an evolutionary way, better and better values of those parameters."
"20817","        Here's how this was done: each time the program evaluated a board position, it"
"20818","  did so both statically and dynamically. The answer gotten by looking ahead-let us"
"20819","  call it D-was used in determining the move to be made. The purpose of S, the static"
"20820","  evaluation, was trickier: on each move, the variable parameters were readjusted"
"20821","  slightly so that S approximated D"
"20822","Artificial Intelligence: Retrospects                                                     600"

"20824","  as accurately as possible. The effect was to partially encode in the values of the"
"20825","  static evaluation’s parameters the knowledge gained by dynamically searching the"
"20826","  tree. In short, the idea was to ""flatten"" the complex dynamic evaluation method into"
"20827","  the much simpler and more efficient static evaluation function."
"20828","        There is a rather nice recursive effect here. The point is that the dynamic"
"20829","  evaluation of any single board position involves looking ahead a finite number of"
"20830","  moves-say seven. Now each of the scads of board positions which might turn up"
"20831","  seven turns down the road has to be itself evaluated somehow as well. But when the"
"20832","  program evaluates these positions, it certainly cannot look another seven moves"
"20833","  ahead, lest it have to look fourteen positions ahead, then twenty-one, etc., etc.-an"
"20834","  infinite regress. Instead, it relies on static evaluations of positions seven moves"
"20835","  ahead. Therefore, in Samuel's scheme, an intricate sort of feedback takes place,"
"20836","  wherein the program is constantly trying to ""flatten"" look-ahead evaluation into a"
"20837","  simpler static recipe; and this recipe in turn plays a key role in the dynamic look-"
"20838","  ahead evaluation. Thus the two are intimately linked together, and each benefits"
"20839","  from improvements in the other in a recursive way."
"20840","        The level of play of the Samuel checkers program is extremely high: of the"
"20841","  order of the top human players in the world. If this is so, why not apply the same"
"20842","  techniques to chess? An international committee, convened in 1961 to study the"
"20843","  feasibility of computer chess, including the Dutch International Grandmaster and"
"20844","  mathematician Max Euwe, came to the bleak conclusion that the Samuel technique"
"20845","  would be approximately one million times as difficult to implement in chess as in"
"20846","  checkers, and that seems to close the book on that."
"20847","        The extraordinarily great skill of the checkers program cannot be taken as"
"20848","  saying ""intelligence has been achieved""; yet it should not be minimized, either. It is"
"20849","  a combination of insights into what checkers is, how to think about checkers, and"
"20850","  how to program. Some people might feel that all it shows is Samuel's own checkers"
"20851","  ability. But this is not true, for at least two reasons. One is that skillful game players"
"20852","  choose their moves according to mental processes which they do not fully"
"20853","  understand-they use their intuitions. Now there is no known way that anyone can"
"20854","  bring to light all of his own intuitions; the best one can do via introspection is to"
"20855","  use ""feeling"" or ""meta-intuition""-an intuition about one's intuitions-as a guide, and"
"20856","  try to describe what one thinks one's intuitions are all about. But this will only give"
"20857","  a rough approximation to the true complexity of intuitive methods. Hence it is"
"20858","  virtually certain that Samuel has not mirrored his own personal methods of play in"
"20859","  his program. The other reason that Samuel's program's play should not be confused"
"20860","  with Samuel's own play is that Samuel does not play checkers as well as his"
"20861","  program-it beats him. This is not a paradox at all-no more than is the fact that a"

"20969","it that the filthy English language is asking to be cleansed? One could go on and on in"
"20970","this game. In this case, the phrase is a joke, and one is supposed to pretend, on some"
"20971","level, that the truck itself wrote the phrase and is requesting a wash. On another level, one"
"20972","clearly recognizes the writing as that of a child, and enjoys the humor of the misdirection."
"20973","Here, in fact, is a game based on reading the ""me"" at the wrong level."
"20974","      Precisely this kind of ambiguity has arisen in this book, first in the"

"21014","are included in TNT, as a matter of fact. The trick in writing such a program is to instill a"

"21016","on ""relevant"" pathways-those which, by some reasonable criterion, seem to be leading"
"21017","towards the desired string."
"21018","     In this book we have not dealt much with such issues. How indeed can you know"
"21019","when you are proceeding towards a theorem, and how can you tell if what you are doing"

"21320","easy is it to insert new knowledge? How easy is it to revise old knowledge? How modular"
"21321","are books? It all depends. If from a tightly structured book with many cross-references a"

"21323","is like trying to pull a single strand out of a spider web-you ruin the whole in doing so."
"21324","On the other hand, some books are quite modular, having independent chapters."
"21325","         Consider a straightforward theorem-generating program which uses TNT's"
"21326","axioms and rules of inference. The ""knowledge"" of such a program has two aspects. It"
"21327","resides implicitly in the axioms and rules, and explicitly in the body of theorems which"
"21328","have so far been produced. Depending on which way you look at the knowledge, you will"
"21329","see it either as modular or as spread all around and completely nonmodular. For instance,"
"21330","suppose you had written such a program but had forgotten to include TNT's Axiom I in"
"21331","the list of axioms. After the program had done many thousands of derivations, you"
"21332","realized your oversight, and inserted the new axiom. The fact that you can do so in a trice"

"21335","effects have ""dif-"
"21336","Artificial Intelligence: Retrospects                                                      613"

"21339","broken. In that sense the new knowledge takes a long time to be incorporated."
"21340","Furthermore, if you wanted to go back and replace Axiom I by its negation, you could not"
"21341","just do that by itself; you would have to delete all theorems which had involved Axiom 1"
"21342","in their derivations. Clearly this system's explicit knowledge is not nearly so modular as"
"21343","its implicit knowledge."
"21344","        It would be useful if we learned how to transplant knowledge modularly. Then to"
"21345","teach everyone French, we would just open up their heads and operate in a fixed way on"
"21346","their neural structures-then they would know how to speak French. Of course, this is only"
"21347","a hilarious pipe dream."
"21348","        Another aspect of knowledge representation has to do with the way in which one"
"21349","wishes to use the knowledge. Are inferences supposed to be drawn as pieces of"
"21350","information arrive? Should analogies and comparisons constantly be being made between"
"21351","new information and old information? In a chess program, for instance, if you want to"
"21352","generate look-ahead trees, then a representation which encodes board positions with a"
"21353","minimum of redundancy will be preferable to one which repeats the information in"
"21354","several different ways. But if you want your program to ""understand"" a board position by"
"21355","looking for patterns and comparing them to known patterns, then representing the same"
"21356","information several times over in different forms will be more useful."
"21357","                Representing Knowledge in a Logical Formalism"
"21358","There are various schools of thought concerning the best way to represent and manipulate"
"21359","knowledge. One which has had great influence advocates representations using formal"
"21360","notations similar to those for TNT-using propositional connectives and quantifiers. The"
"21361","basic operations in such representations are, not surprisingly, formalizations of deductive"
"21362","reasoning. Logical deductions can be made using rules of inference analogous to some of"
"21363","those in TNT. Querying the system about some particular idea sets up a goal in the form"
"21364","of a string to be derived. For example: ""Is MUMON a theorem?"" Then the automatic"
"21365","reasoning mechanisms take over in a goal oriented way, using various methods of"
"21366","problem reduction."
"21367","        For example, suppose that the proposition ""All formal arithmetics are incomplete"""
"21368","were known, and the program were queried, ""Is Principia Mathematica incomplete?"" In"
"21369","scanning the list of known facts-often called the data base-the system might notice that if"
"21370","it could establish that Principia Mathematica is a formal arithmetic, then it could answer"
"21371","the question. Therefore the proposition ""Principia Mathematica is a formal arithmetic"""
"21372","would be set up as a subgoal, and then problem reduction would take over. If it could find"
"21373","further things which would help in establishing (or refuting) the goal or the subgoal, it"
"21374","would work on them-and so on, recursively. This process is given the name of backwards"
"21375","chaining, since it begins with the goal and works its way backwards, presumably towards"
"21376","things which may already be known. If one makes a graphic representation of the main"
"21377","goal,"
"21378","Artificial Intelligence: Retrospects                                                   614"

"21381","may involve several different subgoals, each of which in turn involves several"
"21382","subsubgoals, etc."
"21383","        Notice that this method is not guaranteed to resolve the question, for there may be"
"21384","no way of establishing within the system that Principia Mathematica is a formal"
"21385","arithmetic. This does not imply, however, that either the goal or the subgoal is a false"
"21386","statement-merely that they cannot be derived with the knowledge currently available to"
"21387","the system. The system may print out, in such a circumstance, ""I do not know"" or words"

"21389","incompleteness from which certain well-known formal systems suffer."

"21391","This method affords a deductive awareness of the domain that is represented, in that"

"21393","something of the human ability to spot similarities and to compare situations-it misses"
"21394","what might be called analogical awareness-a crucial side of human intelligence. This is"

"21399","        When you realize that knowledge representation is an altogether different ball"
"21400","game than mere storage of numbers, then the idea that ""a computer has the memory of an"
"21401","elephant"" is an easy myth to explode. What is stored in memory is not necessarily"
"21402","synonymous with what a program knows; for even if a given piece of knowledge is"

"21408","recurring level distinctions, from which we can probably learn much about our own"

"21430","which he described a simple but flexible grammar which could produce a wide variety of"
"21431","sentences of the type found in some children's books. I modified some of the ideas I'd"

"21435","the overall structure of the sentence; gradually the decision-making process trickled down"
"21436","through lower levels of structure until the word level and the letter level were reached. A"
"21437","lot had to be done below the word level, such as inflecting verbs and making plurals of"
"21438","nouns; also irregular verb and noun forms were first formed regularly, and then if they"
"21439","matched entries in a table, substitutions of the proper (irregular) forms were made. As"
"21440","each word reached its final form, it was printed out. The program was like the proverbial"
"21441","monkey at a typewriter, but operating on several levels of linguistic structure"
"21442","simultaneously-not just the letter level."
"21443","        In the early stages of developing the program, I used a totally silly vocabulary-"
"21444","deliberately, since I was aiming at humor. It produced a lot of nonsense sentences, some"

"21486","complicated. All words were branded in several different dimensions. Common"

"21744","exactly, of MICROPLANNER, a partial implementation of the plans for PLANNER. In"
"21745","the past few years, however, people with the goal of developing At have concluded that"

"21770","subject of frequencies-the top twelve letters in English, in order, according to"
"21771","Mergenthaler, are: ""ETAOIN SHRDLU""."
"21772","         One amusing feature of SHRDLU which runs totally against the stereotype of"
"21773","computers as ""number crunchers"" is this fact, pointed out by Winograd: ""Our system does"
"21774","not accept numbers in numeric form, and has only been taught to count to ten.""19 With"
"21775","all its mathematical underpinning, SHRDLU is a mathematical ignoramus! Just like Aunt"
"21776","Hillary, SHRDLU doesn't know anything about the lower levels which make it up. Its"
"21777","knowledge is largely procedural (see particularly the remark by ""Dr, Tony Earrwig"" in"
"21778","section 11 of the previous Dialogue)."
"21779","         It is interesting to contrast the procedural embedding of knowledge in SHRDLU"
"21780","with the knowledge in my sentence-generation program. All of the syntactical knowledge"
"21781","in my program was procedurally embedded in Augmented Transition Networks, written"
"21782","in the language Algol; but the semantic knowledge-the information about semantic class"
"21783","membership-was static: it was contained in a short list of numbers after each word. There"
"21784","were a few words, such as the auxiliary verbs ""to be"", ""to have"", and others, which were"
"21785","represented totally in procedures in Algol, but they were the exceptions. By contrast, in"
"21786","SHRDLU, all words were represented as programs. Here is a case which demonstrates"
"21787","that, despite the theoretical equivalence of data and programs, in practice the choice of"
"21788","one over the other has major consequences."
"21789","                                   Syntax and Semantics"
"21790","And now, a few more words from Winograd:"
"21791","    Our program does not operate by first parsing a sentence, then doing semantic"
"21792","    analysis, and finally by using deduction to produce a response. These three"
"21793","    activities go on concurrently throughout the understanding of a sentence. As soon"
"21794","    as a piece of syntactic structure begins to take shape, a semantic program"
"21795","    is called to see whether it might make sense, and the resultant answer can direct the"
"21796","    parsing. In deciding whether it makes sense, the semantic routine may call"
"21797","    deductive processes and ask questions about the real world. As an"
"21798","    example, in sentence 34 of the Dialogue (""Put the blue pyramid on the block in the"
"21799","    box""), the parser first comes up with ""the blue pyramid on the block"" as a candidate"
"21800","    for a noun group. At this point, semantic analysis is done, and since ""the"" is"
"21801","    definite, a check is made in the data base for the object being referred to. When no"
"21802","    such object is found, the parsing is redirected to find the noun group ""the blue"
"21803","    pyramid"". It will then go on to find ""on the block"
"21804","Artificial Intelligence: Retrospects                                                    626"

"21806","   in the box"" as a single phrase indicating a location .-.. Thus there is a continuing"
"21807","   interplay between the different sorts of analysis, with the results of one affecting"
"21808","   the others .20"
"21809","        It is extremely interesting that in natural language, syntax and semantics are so"
"21810","deeply intertwined. Last Chapter, in discussing the elusive concept of ""form"", we had"
"21811","broken the notion into two categories: syntactic form, which is detectable by a"
"21812","predictably terminating decision procedure, and semantic form, which is not. But here,"
"21813","Winograd is telling us that-at least when the usual senses of ""syntax"" and ""semantics"" are"
"21814","taken-they merge right into each other, in natural language. The external form of a"
"21815","sentence-that is, its composition in terms of elementary signs-does not divide up so neatly"
"21816","into syntactic and semantic aspects. This significant point for linguistics."
"21817","        Here are some final comments on SHRDLU by Winograd."
"21818","Let us look at what the system would do with a simple description like ""a red cube which"
"21819","supports a pyramid"". The description will use concepts like BLOCK, RED, PYRAMID,"

"21827","   flow chart like that in Figure 118. Note that this is a program for finding an object"
"21828","   fitting the description. It would_ then be incorporated into a command for doing"
"21829","   something with the object, a question asking something about it, or, if it appeared in"
"21830","   a statement, it would become part of the program which was generated to represent"
"21831","   the meaning for later use. Note that this bit of program could also be used as a test"
"21832","   to see whether an object fit the description, if the first FIND instruction were told"
"21833","   in advance to look only at that particular object."
"21834","            At first glance, it seems that there is too much structure in this program, as"
"21835","   we don't like to think of the meaning of a simple phrase as explicitly containing"
"21836","   loops, conditional tests, and other programming details. The solution is to provide"
"21837","   an internal language that contains the appropriate looping and checking as its"
"21838","   primitives, and in which the representation of the process is as simple as the"
"21839","   description. The program described in Figure 11S would be written in PLANNER"
"21840","   looking something like what is below:"
"21841","                         (GOAL (IS ?X 1 BLOCK))"
"21842","                         (GOAL (COLOR-OF ?X1 RED))"

"21845","                         (GOAL (SUPPORT ?X1 ?X2))"
"21846","   The loops of the flowchart are implicit in PLANNER'S backtrack control structure."
"21847","   The description is evaluated by proceeding down the list until some goal fails, at"
"21848","   which time the system backs up automatically to the last point where a decision"
"21849","   was made, trying a different possibility. A decision can be made whenever a new"
"21850","   object name or VARIABLE (indicated by the prefix"
"21851","   "") such as ""?X 1"" or ""?X2"" appears. The variables are used by the pattern matcher."
"21852","   If' they have already been assigned to a particular item, it checks to see whether the"
"21853","   GOAL is true for that item. If not, it checks for all possible items which satisfy the"
"21854","   GOAL, by choosing one, and then taking successive ones whenever backtracking"
"21855","   occurs to that point. Thus, even the distinction between testing and choosing is"
"21856","   implicit.21"
"21857","One significant strategy decision in devising this program was to not translate all the way"
"21858","from English into LISP, but only partway-into PLANNER. Thus (since the PLANNER"
"21859","interpreter is itself written in LISP), a new intermediate level-PLANNER-was inserted"
"21860","between the top-level language (English) and the bottom-level language (machine"
"21861","language). Once a PLANNER program had been made from an English sentence"
"21862","fragment, then it could be sent off to the PLANNER interpreter, and the higher levels of"
"21863","SHRDLU would be freed up, to work on new tasks."
"21864","         This kind of decision constantly crops up: How many levels should a system"

"22246","Steiner, who, in his book After Babel, has written:"
"22247","   Hypotheticals, 'imaginaries', conditionals, the syntax of counter-factuality and"

"22253","   Ours is the ability, the need, to gainsay or 'un-say' the world, to image and speak it"
"22254","   otherwise.... We need a word which will designate the power, the compulsion of"
"22255","   language to posit 'otherness'. . . . Perhaps 'alternity' will do: to define the `other than"
"22256","   the case', the counter-factual propositions, images, shapes of will and evasion with"
"22257","   which we charge our mental being and by means of which we build the changing,"
"22258","   largely fictive milieu of our somatic and our social existence... ."

"22265","possibilities beyond the treadmill of organic decay and death .3"
"22266","        The manufacture of ""subjunctive worlds"" happens so casually, -so naturally, that"
"22267","we hardly notice what we are doing. We select from our fantasy a world which is close,"
"22268","in some internal mental sense, to the real world. We compare what is real with what we"
"22269","perceive as almost real. In so doing, what we gain is some intangible kind of perspective"
"22270","on reality. The Sloth is a droll example of a variation on reality-a thinking being without"
"22271","the ability to slip into subjunctives (or at least, who claims to be without the ability-but"
"22272","you may have noticed that what he says is full of counterfactuals'.). Think how"
"22273","immeasurably poorer our mental lives would be if we didn't have this creative capacity"
"22274","for slipping out of the midst of reality into soft ""what if'-s! And from the point of view of"

"22276","happens completely without conscious direction, which means that observation of what"
"22277","kinds of things slip, versus what kinds don't, affords a good window on the unconscious"

"22313","         We build up our mental representation of a situation layer by layer. The lowest"

"22315","vary at all. For instance, the three-dimensionality of our world is so ingrained that most"
"22316","of us never would imagine letting it slip mentally. It is a constant constant. Then there are"
"22317","layers which establish temporarily, though not permanently, fixed aspects of situations,"
"22318","which could be called background assumptions-things which, in the back of your mind,"
"22319","you know can vary, but which most of the time you unquestioningly accept as"
"22320","unchanging aspects. These could still be called ""constants"". For instance, when you go to"
"22321","a football game, the rules of the game are constants of that sort. Then there are"
"22322","""parameters"": you think of them as more variable, but you temporarily hold them"
"22323","constant. At a football game, parameters might include the weather, the opposing team,"
"22324","and so forth. There could be-and probably are-several layers of parameters. Finally, we"

"22329","The word frame is in vogue in Al currently, and it could be defined as a computational"
"22330","instantiation of a context. The term is due to Marvin Minsky, as are many ideas about"
"22331","frames, though the general concept has been floating around for a good number of years."
"22332","In frame language, one could say that mental representations of situations involve frames"
"22333","nested within each other. Each of the various ingredients of a situation has its own frame."
"22334","It is interesting to verbalize explicitly one of my mental images concerning nested"
"22335","frames. Imagine a large collection of chests of drawers. When you choose a chest, you"
"22336","have a frame, and the drawer holes are places where ""subframes"" can be attached. But"
"22337","subframes are themselves chests of drawers. How can you stick a whole chest of drawers"
"22338","into the slot for a single drawer in another chest of drawers? Easy: you shrink and distort"
"22339","the second chest, since, after all, this is all mental, not physical. Now in the outer frame,"
"22340","there may be several different drawer slots that need to be"
"22341","Artificial Intelligence:Prospects                                                         641"
"22342",""
"22343","filled; then you may need to fill slots in some of the inner chests of drawers (or"
"22344","subframes). This can go on, recursively."
"22345","         The vivid surrealistic image of squishing and bending a chest of drawers so that it"
"22346","can fit into a slot of arbitrary shape is probably quite important, because it hints that your"
"22347","concepts are squished and bent by the contexts you force them into. Thus, what does your"
"22348","concept of ""person"" ', become when the people you are thinking about are football"
"22349","players? It certainly is a distorted concept, one which is forced on you by the overall"
"22350","context. You have stuck the ""person"" frame into a slot in the ""football game"" frame. The"
"22351","theory of representing knowledge in frames relies on the idea that the world consists of"
"22352","quasi-closed subsystems, each of which can serve as a context for others without being"
"22353","too disrupted, or creating too much disruption, in the process."
"22354","         One of the main ideas about frames is that each frame comes with its own set of"
"22355","expectations. The corresponding image is that each chest. of drawers comes with a built-"
"22356","in, but loosely bound, drawer in each of its"
"22357","drawer slots, called a default. If I tell you, ""Picture a river bank"", you will invoke a visual"
"22358","image which has various features, most of which you could override if I added extra"
"22359","phrases such as ""in a drought"" or ""in Brazil"" or ""without a merry-go-round"". The"
"22360","existence of default values for slots allows the recursive process of filling slots to come to"
"22361","an end. In effect, you say, ""I will fill in the slots myself as far as three layers down;"
"22362","beyond that I will take the default options."" Together with its default expectations, a"
"22363","frame contains knowledge of its limits of applicability, and heuristics for switching to"
"22364","other frames in case it has been stretched beyond its limits of tolerance."
"22365","         The nested structure of a frame gives you a way of ""zooming in"" and looking at"
"22366","small details from as close up as you wish: you just zoom in on the proper subframe, and"
"22367","then on one of its subframes, etc., until you have the desired amount of detail. It is like"
"22368","having a road atlas of the USA which has a map of the whole country in the front, with"
"22369","individual state maps inside, and even maps of cities and some of the larger towns if you"
"22370","want still more detail. One can imagine an atlas with arbitrary amounts of detail, going"
"22371","down to single blocks, houses, rooms, etc. It is like looking through a telescope with"
"22372","lenses of different power; each lens has its own uses. It is important that one can make"
"22373","use of all the different scales; often detail is irrelevant and even distracting."
"22374","         Because arbitrarily different frames can be stuck inside other frames' slots, there"
"22375","is great potential for conflict or ""collision"". The nice neat scheme of a single, global set of"
"22376","layers of ""constants"", ""parameters"", and ""variables"" is an oversimplification. In fact, each"
"22377","frame will have its own hierarchy of variability, and this is what makes analyzing how we"
"22378","perceive such a complex event as a football game, with its many subframes,"
"22379","subsubframes, etc., an incredibly messy operation. How do all these many frames interact"
"22380","with each other? If there is a conflict where one frame says, ""This item is a constant"" but"

"22501","   other is the idea of Sam-a ""sameness detector""."
"22502","        First Sam. Sam is a special agent present on all levels of the program."
"22503","   (Actually there may be different kinds of Sams on different levels.) Sam"
"22504","   constantly runs around within individual descriptions and within different"
"22505","   descriptions, looking for descriptors or other things which are repeated. When"
"22506","   some sameness is found, various restructuring operations can be triggered, either"
"22507","   on the single-description level or on the level of several descriptions at once."
"22508","   Now templates. The first thing that happens after preprocessing is an attempt to"
"22509","   manufacture a template, or description-schema-a un form format for the"
"22510","   descriptions of all the boxes in a problem. The idea is that a description can often"
"22511","   be broken up in a natural way into subdescriptions, and those in turn into subs"
"22512","   ubdescriptions, if need be. The bottom is hit when you come to primitive concepts"
"22513","   which belong to the level of the preprocessor. Now it is important to choose the"
"22514","   way of breaking descriptions into parts so as to reflect commonality among all the"
"22515","   boxes; otherwise you are introducing a superfluous and meaningless kind of"
"22516","   ""pseudo-order"" into the world."
"22517","        On the basis of what information is a template built? It is best to look at an"

"22534","   the terms ""interior"" and ""exterior"". The concept net is just brimming with"
"22535","   information about relations between terms, such as what is the opposite of what,"

"22538","   follow what happens now, in the solution of problem 49. The concepts ""interior"""
"22539","   and ""exterior"" are activated by their proximity in the net to ""closed curve"". This"
"22540","   suggests to the template-builder that it might be a good idea to make distinct slots"
"22541","   for the interior and exterior of the curve. Thus, in the spirit of tentativity, the"
"22542","   template is tentatively restructured to be this:"

"22547","   cause procedures to inspect those specific regions of the box. What is found in BP"
"22548","   49, box I-A is this:"
"22549","        large closed curve: circle"

"22647","   repetition of recent methods is very common in the real world, and Bongard does"

"22668","   an amount of variety that it is hard to know where to begin. But this is in itself a"
"22669","   clue! The clue says, namely, that the class distinction very likely exists on a higher"
"22670","   level of abstraction than that of geometrical description. This observation clues the"
"22671","   program that it should construct descriptions of descriptions-that is, meta-"
"22672","   descriptions. Perhaps on this second level some common feature will emerge; and"
"22673","   if we are lucky, we will discover enough commonality to guide us towards the"
"22674","   formulation of a template for the meta-descriptions! So we plunge ahead without a"
"22675","   template, and manufacture descriptions for various boxes; then, once these"
"22676","   descriptions have been made, we describe them. What kinds of slot will our"

"22798","and handling real objects-combs, trains, strings, blocks, letters, rubber bands, etc., etc.-"
"22799","play an invisible but significant guiding role in the solution of these puzzles."
"22800","        Conversely, it is certain that understanding real-world situations heavily depends"
"22801","on visual imagery and spatial intuition, so that having a powerful and flexible way of"
"22802","representing patterns such as these Bongard patterns can only contribute to the general"
"22803","efficiency of thought processes."
"22804","It seems to me that Bongard's problems were worked out with great care, and that they"

"22925","Two interesting and complementary ideas concerning the interaction of symbols are"

"22927","symbol (that is, from the symbol which served as a template off of which it was copied)."
"22928","Fusion is what happens when two (or more) originally unrelated symbols participate in a"
"22929","""joint activation"", passing messages so tightly back and forth that they get bound together"
"22930","and the combination can thereafter be addressed as if it were a single symbol. Fission is a"
"22931","more or less inevitable process, since once a new symbol has been ""rubbed off"" of an old"
"22932","one, it becomes autonomous, and its interactions with the outside world get reflected in"
"22933","its private internal structure; so what started out as a perfect copy will soon become"
"22934","imperfect, and then slowly will become less and less like the symbol off of which it was"
"22935","""rubbed"". Fusion is a subtler thing. When do two concepts really become 'one? Is there"
"22936","some precise instant when a fusion takes place?"
"22937","Artificial Intelligence:Prospects                                                       661"

"22939","         This notion of joint activations opens up a Pandora's box of questions. For"

"22941","German who thinks of gloves (""Handschuhe"") hear ""hand-shoes"" or not? How about"
"22942","Chinese people, whose word ""dong-xi"" (""East-West"") means ""thing""? It is a matter of"
"22943","some political concern, too, since some people claim that words like ""chairman"" are"
"22944","heavily charged with undertones of the male gender. The degree to which the parts"
"22945","resonate inside the whole probably varies from person to person and according to"
"22946","circumstances."
"22947","         The real problem with this notion of ""fusion"" of symbols is that it is very hard to"
"22948","imagine general algorithms which will create meaningful new symbols from colliding"
"22949","symbols. It is like two strands of DNA which come together. How do you take parts from"
"22950","each and recombine them into a meaningful and viable new strand of DNA which codes"
"22951","for an individual of the same species? Or a new kind of species? The chance is"
"22952","infinitesimal that a random combination of pieces of DNA will code for anything that"

"22957","                            Epigenesis of the Crab Canon"
"22958","I think of my Dialogue Crab Canon as a prototype example where two ideas collided in"
"22959","my mind, connected in a new way, and suddenly a new kind of verbal structure came"
"22960","alive in my mind. Of course I can still think about musical crab canons and verbal"
"22961","dialogues separately-they can still be activated independently of each other; but the fused"
"22962","symbol for crab canonical dialogues has its own characteristic modes of activation, too."
"22963","To illustrate this notion of fusion or ""symbolic recombination"" in some detail, then, I"
"22964","would like to use the development of my Crab Canon as a case study, because, of course,"
"22965","it is very familiar to me, and also because it is interesting, yet typical of how far a single"
"22966","idea can be pushed. I will recount it in stages named after those of meiosis, which is the"
"22967","name for cell division in which ""crossing-over"", or genetic recombination, takes place-the"
"22968","source of diversity in evolution."
"22969","         PROPHASE: I began with a rather simple idea-that a piece of music, say a canon,"
"22970","could be imitated verbally. This came from the observation that, through a shared abstract"
"22971","form, a piece of text and a piece of music may be connected. The next step involved"
"22972","trying to realize some of the potential of this vague hunch; here, I hit upon the idea that"
"22973","""voices"" in canons can be mapped onto ""characters"" in dialogues-still a rather obvious"
"22974","idea."
"22975","         Then I focused down onto specific kinds of canons, and remembered that there"
"22976","was a crab canon in the Musical Offering. At that time, I had just"
"22977","Artificial Intelligence:Prospects                                                         662"
"22978",""
"22979","begun writing Dialogues, and there were only two characters: Achilles and the Tortoise."
"22980","Since the Bach crab canon has two voices, this mapped perfectly: Achilles should be one"
"22981","voice, the Tortoise the other, with the one doing forwards what the other does backwards."
"22982","But here I was faced with a problem: on what level should the reversal take place? The"
"22983","letter level? The word level? The sentence level? After some thought, I concluded that"
"22984","the ""dramatic line"" level would be most appropriate."
"22985","         Now that the ""skeleton"" of the Bach crab canon had been transplanted, at least in"
"22986","plan, into a verbal form, there was just one problem. When the two voices crossed in the"
"22987","middle, there would be a short period of extreme repetition: an ugly blemish. What to do"
"22988","about it? Here, a strange thing happened, a kind of level-crossing typical of creative acts:"
"22989","the word ""crab"" in ""crab canon"" flashed into my mind, undoubtedly because of some"
"22990","abstract shared quality with the notion of ""tortoise""-and immediately I realized that at the"
"22991","dead center, I could block the repetitive effect, by inserting one special line, said by a"
"22992","new character: a Crab! This is how, in the ""prophase"" of the Crab Canon, the Crab was"
"22993","conceived: at the crossing over of Achilles and the Tortoise. (See Fig. 131.)"
"22994","FIGURE 131. A schematic diagram of the Dialogue Crab Canon."
"22995","         METAPHASE: This was the skeleton of my Crab Canon. I then entered the"
"22996","second stage-the ""metaphase""-in which I had to fill in the flesh, which was of course an"
"22997","arduous task. I made a lot of stabs at it, getting used to the way in which pairs of"
"22998","successive lines had to make sense when read from either direction, and experimenting"
"22999","around to see what kinds of dual meanings would help me in writing such a form (e.g.,"
"23000","""Not at all""). There were two early versions both of which were interesting, but weak. I"
"23001","abandoned work on the book for over a year, and when I returned to the Crab Canon, I"
"23002","had a few new ideas. One of them was to mention a Bach canon inside it. At first my plan"
"23003","was to mention the ""Canon per augmentationem, contrario motu"", from the Musical"
"23004","Offering (Sloth Canon, as I call it). But that started to seem a little silly, so reluctantly I"
"23005","decided that inside my Crab Canon, I could talk about Bach's own Crab Canon instead."
"23006","Actually, this was a crucial turning point, but I didn't know it then."
"23007","         Now if one character was going to mention a Bach piece, wouldn't it be awkward"
"23008","for the other to say exactly the same thing in the corresponding place? Well, Escher was"
"23009","playing a similar role to Bach in my thoughts and my book, so wasn't there some way of"
"23010","just slightly modifying the line so that it would refer to Escher? After all, in the strict art"
"23011","of canons, note-perfect imitation is occasionally foregone for the sake of elegance or"
"23012","beauty. And"
"23013","Artificial Intelligence:Prospects                                                          663"
"23014",""
"23015","no sooner did that idea occur to me than the picture Day and Night (Fig. 49) popped into"
"23016","my mind. ""Of course!"" I thought, ""It is a sort of pictorial crab canon, with essentially two"
"23017","complementary voices carrying the same theme both leftwards and rightwards, and"
"23018","harmonizing with each other!"" Here again was the notion of a single ""conceptual"
"23019","skeleton"" being instantiated in two different media-in this case, music and art. So I let the"
"23020","Tortoise talk about Bach, and Achilles talk about Escher, in parallel language; certainly"
"23021","this slight departure from strict imitation retained the spirit of crab cano.is."
"23022","         At this point, I began realizing that something marvelous was happening namely,"
"23023","the Dialogue was becoming self-referential, without my even having intended it! What's"
"23024","more, it was an indirect self-reference, in that the characters did not talk directly about"
"23025","the Dialogue they were in, but rather about structures which were isomorphic to it (on a"
"23026","certain plane of abstraction). To put it in the terms I have been using, my Dialogue now"
"23027","shared a ""conceptual skeleton"" with Gödel’s G, and could therefore be mapped onto G in"
"23028","somewhat the way that the Central Dogma was, to create in this case a ""Central"
"23029","Crabmap"". This was most exciting to me, since out of nowhere had come an esthetically"
"23030","pleasing unity of Gödel, Escher, and Bach."
"23031","         ANAPHASE: The next step was quite startling. I had had Caroline MacGillavry's"
"23032","monograph on Escher's tessellations for years, but one day, as I flipped through it, my"
"23033","eye was riveted to Plate 23 (Fig. 42), for I saw it in a way I had never seen it before: here"
"23034","was a genuine crab canon-crab-like in both form and content! Escher himself had given"
"23035","the picture no title, and since he had drawn similar tessellations using many other animal"
"23036","forms, it is probable that this coincidence of form and content was just something which I"
"23037","had noticed. But fortuitous or not, this untitled plate was a miniature version of one main"
"23038","idea of my book: to unite form and content. So with delight I christened it Crab Canon,"
"23039","substituted it for Day and Night, and modified Achilles' and the Tortoise's remarks"
"23040","accordingly."
"23041","         Yet this was not all. Having become infatuated with molecular biology, one day I"
"23042","was perusing Watson's book in the bookstore, and in the index saw the word"
"23043","""palindrome"". When I looked it up, I found a magical thing: crab-canonical structures in"
"23044","DNA. Soon the Crab's comments had been suitably modified to include a short remark to"
"23045","the effect that he owed his predilection for confusing retrograde and forward motion to"
"23046","his genes."
"23047","         TELOPHASE: The last step came months later, when, as I was talking about the"
"23048","picture of the crab-canonical section of DNA (Fig. 43), 1 saw that the 'A', 'T', 'C' of"
"23049","Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine coincided- mirabile dictu-with the 'A', 'T', 'C' of Achilles,"
"23050","Tortoise, Crab; moreover, just as Adenine and Thymine are paired in DNA, so are"
"23051","Achilles and the Tortoise paired in the Dialogue. I thought for a moment and, in another"
"23052","of those level-crossings, saw that 'G', the letter paired with 'C' in DNA, could stand for"
"23053","""Gene"". Once again, I jumped back to the Dialogue, did a little surgery on the Crab's"
"23054","speech to reflect this new discovery, and now I had a mapping between the DNA's"
"23055","structure, and the Dialogue's structure. In that sense, the DNA could be said to be a"

"23062","That more or less summarizes the epigenesis of the Crab Canon. The whole process can"
"23063","be seen as a succession of mappings of ideas onto each other, at varying levels of"
"23064","abstraction. This is what I call conceptual mapping, and the abstract structures which"
"23065","connect up two different ideas are conceptual skeletons. Thus, one conceptual skeleton is"
"23066","that of the abstract notion of a crab canon:"
"23067","                    a structure having two parts which do the same thing,"
"23068","                              only moving in opposite directions."
"23069","         This is a concrete geometrical image which can be manipulated by the mind"
"23070","almost as a Bongard pattern. In fact, when I think of the Crab Canon today, I visualize it"
"23071","as two strands which cross in the middle, where they are joined by a ""knot"" (the Crab's"
"23072","speech). This is such a vividly pictorial image that it instantaneously maps, in my mind,"
"23073","onto a picture of two homologous chromosomes joined by a centromere in their middle,"
"23074","which is an image drawn directly from meiosis, as shown in Figure 132."

"23092","into view, then going ahead and mapping the parts onto each other, and so on,"
"23093","recursively, to any level that was found desirable. Here, for instance, ""voice"" and"

"23253","         It is a common notion that randomness is an indispensable ingredient of creative"
"23254","acts. This may be true, but it does not have any bearing on the mechanizability-or rather,"
"23255","programmability!-of creativity. The world is a giant heap of randomness; when you"
"23256","mirror some of it inside your head, your head's interior absorbs a little of that"
"23257","randomness. The triggering patterns of symbols, therefore, can lead you down the most"
"23258","randomseeming paths, simply because they came from your interactions with a crazy,"

"23261","through dice, decaying nuclei, random number tables, or what-have-you. It is an insult to"

"23918","you're in the shower and you wash your left arm with your right, and then vice versa."
"23919","There is no strangeness to the image. Escher didn't choose to draw hands drawing hands"

"23925","        On the other hand, where language does create strange loops is when it talks"

"23960","         But what happens when there is no higher court, and the Supreme Court itself gets"
"23961","all tangled up in legal troubles? This sort of snarl nearly happened in the Watergate era."
"23962","The President threatened to obey only a ""definitive ruling"" of the Supreme Court-then"
"23963","claimed he had the right to decide what is ""definitive"". Now that threat never was made"
"23964","good; but if it had been, it would have touched off a monumental confrontation between"

"23985","         An analogy from physics is useful here. As was mentioned earlier in the book,"

"24223","The other was the mixing of subject and object in metamathematics, beginning with"

"24227","perhaps an even more tangled one than that of humans studying their own minds."
"24228","         By the way, in passing, it is interesting to note that all results essentially"

"24548","    In my own hypothetical brain model, conscious awareness does get representation"
"24549","    as a very real causal agent and rates an important place in the causal sequence and"
"24550","    chain of control in brain events, in which it appears as an active, operational"

"24555","    forces; what is more, there are forces within forces within forces, as in no other"

"24560","    activity.... Near the apex of this command system in the brain ... we find ideas. Man"
"24561","    over the chimpanzee has ideas and ideals. In the brain model proposed here, the"
"24562","    causal potency of an idea, or an ideal, becomes just as real as that of a molecule, a"

"24566","    also interact with the external surroundings to produce in toto a burstwise advance"
"24567","    in evolution that is far beyond anything to hit the evolutionary scene yet, including"
"24568","    the emergence of the living cell.'"
"24569","         There is a famous breach between two languages of discourse: the subjective"
"24570","language and the objective language. For instance, the ""subjective"" sensation of redness,"
"24571","and the ""objective"" wavelength of red light. To many people, these seem to be forever"

"24576","when you step back, outside of the system. Though no one of us will ever be able to step"
"24577","back far enough to see the ""big picture"", we shouldn't forget that it exists. We should"

"24590","what I believe is an equivalent question, but one which involves less loaded terms."

"24594","shed much light on free will it will be helpful to go over a few different systems which,"
"24595","under various circumstances, we might feel tempted to describe as ""making choices""."
"24596","From these examples we can gain some perspective on what we really mean by the"
"24597","phrase."
"24598","         Let us take the following systems as paradigms: a marble rolling down a bumpy"
"24599","hill; a pocket calculator finding successive digits in the decimal expansion of the square"
"24600","root of 2; a sophisticated program which plays a mean game of chess; a robot in a T-maze"
"24601","(a maze with but a single fork, on one side of which there is a reward); and a human"
"24602","being confronting a complex dilemma."
"24603","         First, what about that marble rolling down a hill? Does it make choices? I think"
"24604","we would unanimously say that it doesn't, even though none of us could predict its path"
"24605","for even a very short distance. We feel that it couldn't have gone any other way than it"
"24606","did, and that it was just being shoved along by the relentless laws of nature. In our"
"24607","chunked mental physics, of course, we can visualize many different ""possible"" pathways"
"24608","for the marble, and we see it following only one of them in the real world. On some level"
"24609","of our minds, therefore, we can't help feeling the marble has ""chosen"" a single pathway"
"24610","out of those myriad mental ones; but on some other level of our minds, we have an"
"24611","instinctive understanding that the mental physics is only an aid in our internal modeling"
"24612","of the world, and that the mechanisms which make the real physical sequences of events"
"24613","happen do not require nature to go through an analogous process of first manufacturing"
"24614","variants in some hypothetical universe (the ""brain of God"") and then choosing between"
"24615","them. So we shall not bestow the designation ""choice"" upon this process-although we"
"24616","recognize that it is often pragmatically useful to use the word in cases like this, because"
"24617","of its evocative power."
"24618","         Now what about the calculator programmed to find the digits of the square root of"
"24619","2? What about the chess program? Here, we might say that we are just dealing with"
"24620","""fancy marbles"", rolling down ""fancy hills"". In fact, the arguments for no choice-making"
"24621","here are, if anything, stronger than in the case of a marble. For if you attempt to repeat"
"24622","the marble experiment, you will undoubtedly witness a totally different pathway being"
"24623","traced down the hill, whereas if you rerun the square-root-of-2 program, you will get the"
"24624","same results time after time. The marble seems to ""choose"" a different path each time, no"
"24625","matter how accurately you try to reproduce the conditions of its original descent, whereas"
"24626","the program runs down precisely the same channels each time."
"24627","         Now in the case of fancy chess programs, there are various possibilities."
"24628","Strange Loops, Or Tangled Hierarchies                                                   706"

"24630","If you play a game against certain programs, and then start a second game with the same"
"24631","moves as you made the first time, these programs will just move exactly as they did"
"24632","before, without any appearance of having learned anything or having any desire for"
"24633","variety. There are other programs which have randomizing devices that will give some"
"24634","variety but not out of any deep desire. Such programs could be reset with the internal"
"24635","random number generator as it was the first time, and once again, the same game would"

"24639","all the changes in the memory which represent learning, just as you could reset the"
"24640","random number generator, but that hardly seems like a friendly thing to do. Besides, is"
"24641","there any reason to suspect that you would be able to change any of your own past"
"24642","decisions if every last detail-and that includes your brain, of course-were reset to the way"
"24643","it was the first time around?"
"24644","         But let us return to the question of whether ""choice"" is an applicable term here. If"
"24645","programs are just ""fancy marbles rolling down fancy hills"", do they make choices, or not?"
"24646","Of course the answer must be a subjective one, but I would say that pretty much the same"
"24647","considerations apply here as to the marble. However, I would have to add that the appeal"
"24648","of using the word ""choice"", even if it is only a convenient and evocative shorthand,"
"24649","becomes quite strong. The fact that a chess program looks ahead down the various"
"24650","possible bifurcating paths, quite unlike a rolling marble, makes it seem much more like"
"24651","an animate being than a square-root-of-2 program. However, there is still no deep self-"
"24652","awareness here-and no sense of free will."
"24653","         Now let us go on to imagine a robot which has a repertoire of symbols. This robot"
"24654","is placed in a T-maze. However, instead of going for the reward, it is preprogrammed to"
"24655","go left whenever the next digit of the square root: of 2 is even, and to go right whenever it"
"24656","is odd. Now this robot is capable of modeling the situation in its symbols, so it can watch"
"24657","itself making choices. Each time the T is approached, if you were to address to the robot"
"24658","the question, ""Do you know which way you're going to turn this time?"" it would have to"
"24659","answer, ""No"". Then in order to progress, it would activate its ""decider"" subroutine, which"
"24660","calculates the next digit of the square root of 2, and the decision is taken. However, the"
"24661","internal mechanism of the decider is unknown to the robot-it is represented in the robot's"
"24662","symbols merely as a black box which puts out ""left""'s and ""right""'s by some mysterious"
"24663","and seemingly random rule. Unless the robot's symbols are capable of picking up the"
"24664","hidden heartbeat of the square root of 2, beating in the L's and R's, it will stay baffled by"
"24665","the ""choices"" which it is making. Now does this robot make choices? Put yourself in that"
"24666","position. If you were trapped inside a marble rolling down a hill and were powerless to"
"24667","affect its path, yet could observe it with all your human intellect, would you feel that the"
"24668","marble's path involved choices? Of course not. Unless your mind is affecting the"
"24669","outcome, it makes no difference that the symbols are present."
"24670","Strange Loops, Or Tangled Hierarchies                                                     707"

"24672","So now we make a modification in our robot: we allow its symbols--including its self-"

"24674","fully under physical law, which seems to get much more deeply at the essence of choice"
"24675","than the previous examples did. When the robot's own chunked concept of itself enters"
"24676","the scene, we begin to identify with the robot, for it sounds like the kind of thing we do. It"
"24677","is no longer like the calculation of the square root of 2, where no symbols seem to be"
"24678","monitoring the decisions taken. To be sure, if we were to look at the robot's program on a"
"24679","very local level, it would look quite like the square-root program. Step after step is"
"24680","executed, and in the end ""left"" or ""right"" is the output. But on a high level we can see the"
"24681","fact that symbols are being used to model the situation and to affect the decision. That"
"24682","radically affects our way of thinking about the program. At this stage, meaning has"

"24687","will be sucked inexorably into interaction with the self-symbol, like a rowboat being"
"24688","pulled into a whirlpool. That is the vortex of the system, where all levels cross. Here, the"
"24689","`L' encounters a Tangled Hierarchy of symbols and is passed up and down the levels. The"
"24690","self-symbol is incapable of monitoring all its internal processes, and so when the actual"
"24691","decision emerges-'L' or 'R' or something outside the system-the system will not be able to"
"24692","say where it came from. Unlike a standard chess program, which does not monitor itself"
"24693","and consequently has no ideas about where its moves come from, this program does"
"24694","monitor itself and does have ideas about its ideas-but it cannot monitor its own processes"
"24695","in complete detail, and therefore has a sort of intuitive sense of its workings, without full"
"24696","understanding. From this balance between self-knowledge and self-ignorance comes the"
